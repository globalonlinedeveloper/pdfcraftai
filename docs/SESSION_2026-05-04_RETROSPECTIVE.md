# Session Retrospective — 2026-05-04 multi-day arc

_Hard-won lessons from a long autonomous session that shipped 28 commits across the Pricing/Telemetry plan, post-plan gap closure, production activation, end-to-end smoke test, tool improvement plan, and Tier 1/2 follow-up ships. Reference for future sessions or anyone reviewing this period of work._

## 1. What shipped

### Code-side gaps closed (all 5)
- **Gap #1** — Defer signup bonus to /verify-email (commit `c635015`). Closes layer-3 honesty: free credits now require proven email ownership.
- **Gap #2 Option A** — Per-op signup-bonus cap, feature-flagged (commit `4f3a4c7`). Activated in prod via `BONUS_PER_OP_CAP_ENABLED=true`.
- **Gap #3** — Estimator badge wired into 6 remaining AI tools (commit `c635015`). 9/9 AI tools coverage.
- **Gap #4** — Personalized "last 7 days" recap on OutOfCreditsAlert + rate-limited `/api/account/recent-usage` (commits `8afefa5` + `acb7695`).
- **Gap #5** — Admin grant/debit credit actions on `/admin/users/[id]` (commit `8afefa5`).

### Tier 1/2 plan items shipped
- **T1-1** — Removed `/compress-pdf` bait-and-switch (commit `0ad19d8`).
- **T1-3** — Backfilled 18 missing handoff suggestions (commit `0ad19d8`).
- **T1-2** — Honestly downgraded after audit (real preview gap was much smaller than initial framing).
- **T2-5** — Plumbed `capExceeded` flag through 4-layer chain for friendlier per-tool copy (commit `8d47400`).
- **Compress cleanup follow-up** — Deleted use-case + edited 2 blog posts to remove deeper bait references (commit `b15a64f`).

### Critical bug found + fixed during e2e
- **CSP missing Turnstile origin** (commit `383793a` + SSH `.htaccess` edit + `35abd8c` snapshot). The post-activation e2e smoke caught a release-blocking bug: env-var activation flipped Turnstile from fail-open to fail-closed, but the CSP didn't allow the widget to load. Every credentials registration would have failed silently. Fixed via direct `.htaccess` edit on the server (the Apache layer overrides Next.js's CSP via `Header always unset` + `Header always set`); committed a snapshot at `public/.htaccess.prod-snapshot` so the live config is now visible to source control.

### Production activation
- **Hostinger env vars set live** (via Chrome MCP):
  - `CRON_SECRET=55a29ca5...` (64 hex)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=0x4AAAAAADH0w8NFtw_mwWPx`
  - `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=0x4AAAAAADH0wxWtlmi0hAi8-8HB-zOCYK8`
  - `BONUS_PER_OP_CAP_ENABLED=true` (Gap #2 active)
  - `SIGNUP_GRANT_ENABLED=true`
- **3 cron-job.org schedules** (UTC, failure-auto-disable on):
  - `expire-grants` daily 03:00
  - `reconcile-payments` daily 03:00
  - `ai-margin-rollup` daily 00:15
- **First margin rollup captured 81.6% margin** on Anthropic Haiku 4.5 summarize — well above the 65% floor. Green streak started.

### Documentation suite (8 canonical docs)
- `docs/PRICING_AND_TELEMETRY_PLAN.md` — written retroactively; the plan was conversational across multiple chat sessions before this commit (`83bceb7`)
- `docs/STATUS.md` — running timeline + cascade history
- `docs/NEXT_SESSION.md` — ranked handoff for the next session
- `docs/OPS_RUNBOOK.md` — incident decision flows
- `docs/CRON_JOBS.md` — scheduled-endpoint registry
- `docs/ABUSE_PREVENTION.md` — 8-layer reference
- `docs/GAP2_DESIGN_OPTIONS.md` — Gap #2 decision trail
- `docs/TOOL_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` — 3-tier roadmap, 18 items
- `docs/runbooks/data-breach.md` — DPDP §8(6) protocol (from earlier work)

### CI guards added
- `csp-turnstile` (4 assertions) — locks in CSP origin allowlist
- `gap4-gap5` (58 assertions) — locks in Gap #4 + Gap #5 contracts
- `per-op-bonus-cap` (26 assertions) — locks in Gap #2 helper + spendCredits wire
- `cap-exceeded-wireup` (77 assertions) — locks in T2-5 4-layer chain

Aggregator total: **4696 / 4696 across 79 suites in ~6.5s**.

## 2. The cascade-pattern hypothesis (now validated)

This is the single most important finding from the arc.

### The pattern

| Commit type | Sample size | Cascade rate | Auto-pull jam rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Code-bearing (modifies source code) | ~12 | **~80%** | ~40% |
| Doc-only (`docs/`, `README`, etc.) | ~10 | **0%** | 0% |
| Test-only (`scripts/test-*.mjs`) | ~3 | **0%** | 0% |
| Empty-commit nudge (`--allow-empty`) | ~5 | 0% | 0% |
| Env-var-only redeploy (Hostinger panel) | ~3 | 0% | 0% |

**10 cascades observed** (#1–#6 from prior arc per `CLAUDE.md`, #7–#10 in this arc). Every cascade was on a code-bearing deploy. The cascade frequency correlates with the size of the webpack-cache-invalidation surface — large multi-file route handler changes cascade more reliably than small library-file edits.

### Recovery playbook (ONE pkick rule)

```bash
# Step 1: Confirm cascade — usually 12+ next-server processes accumulated
ssh -i .claude/id_ed25519_cowork -p 65002 u692382124@212.85.28.206 \
  'ps -fu u692382124 | grep -c next-server'

# Step 2: ONE mass-kill + restart trigger
ssh ... 'ps -fu u692382124 | grep next-server | awk "{print \$2}" \
  | xargs -r kill -KILL && touch ~/domains/pdfcraftai.com/nodejs/tmp/restart.txt'

# Step 3: Wait 30-60s, verify
curl -sS https://pdfcraftai.com/api/health
```

### Critical: do NOT pkick twice

If the first pkick doesn't recover within 60s, **STOP**. The second SSH connection often returns `bash: fork: retry: Resource temporarily unavailable` — this means the cgroup thread cap is saturated. Every additional SSH/curl attempt creates pending forks that the cgroup is rejecting, prolonging the saturation. The ONLY recovery from that state without hPanel access is to wait 5-10 minutes for the kernel to drain pending threads.

Validated twice in this arc — cascades #7 and #8 both required the wait path after fork-retry. Cascades #9 and #10 recovered cleanly with one pkick because we stopped trying after the first attempt.

### Auto-pull jam recovery (empty-commit nudge)

If `git log --oneline -1` on the server's `last-source` directory hasn't updated 5+ minutes after `git push`, Hostinger's auto-pull is jammed. Fix:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: nudge Hostinger auto-pull (<sha> stuck)"
git push origin main
```

Validated 5 times in this arc. Empty-commit nudges always unjam within 1-2 minutes. Don't nudge more than once per stuck deploy — repeated nudges queue up and overlap with whatever was jammed.

## 3. Operational discipline learned

### Batch code changes; isolate doc/test changes

Given the cascade rate, the right shipping discipline is:
- **Batch related code edits into one commit** when possible — amortize the cascade cost across more value.
- **Doc-only commits** can ship freely — they're cascade-free.
- **Test-only commits** can ship freely — they're cascade-free.
- **Sequence: code → wait for cascade recovery → docs → tests** (or interleave — order doesn't matter for cascade frequency, but cascading docs commit doesn't add value).

### When to use SSH

For prod-only state (env vars, .htaccess, runtime processes):
- **Env vars**: Hostinger panel UI, never SSH (panel changes survive future deploys; SSH-set env vars get clobbered).
- **`.htaccess`**: SSH is the only path. Keep a snapshot at `public/.htaccess.prod-snapshot` for source-control visibility.
- **Process control**: SSH for ONE pkick recovery. Never use SSH-direct-edit for source code.

### When to use Chrome MCP vs curl

- **Curl**: HTTP-level smoke tests, cron-endpoint verification, health checks, sitemap audits. Fast, scriptable, no UI risk.
- **Chrome MCP**: anything visual (forms, widgets rendering, login flow, admin pages). Required for catching CSS issues + JS console errors.
- **Chrome MCP can NOT**: solve real Turnstile challenges, read user emails, type into terminals/IDEs (per the access tier system). For those, ask the user.

## 4. Decisions that turned out right

### Decision: Path D auth (Google + email + 7 abuse layers) instead of Google-only

The founder pushed back on my Google-only recommendation: "I'm confident I'll lose users without email auth, ship both." The extra ~13h of abuse-stack work was the cost of broader user coverage. Looking back: the email path's bot-defense profile (8 layers, ~₹2 economic value per signup vs $0.50-$5 attacker cost) is now a real moat. Google-only would have left ~30% of acquisitions on the table for a smaller defensive surface.

### Decision: Credits-only display, no rupees per call

Locked early as Principle 1. Eliminates a constant trust-erosion vector ("why does Claude cost 3 credits but Gemini costs 1?") and forces marketing apologetics. Users see consistent unit; rupees only at /buy. Validated in the e2e walkthrough — every tool page, the dashboard, /app/usage, and admin surfaces all hold the line.

### Decision: Hide the supply chain (no provider/model leak in user UI)

Locked as Principle 2. Day 1 commit `9f9c8fe` stripped Provenance footers from 9 tool components. Removed "Anthropic Haiku 4.5" / "OpenAI GPT-5" name leaks from copy. Marketing, tool runners, and result cards all anchor on "AI" generically. Admin sees provider/model in `/admin/tools` and `/admin/margin`; users never do.

### Decision: Pre-flight estimator MUST equal live charge

Forced Day 1.7's multiplier-aware route refactor for translate/redact/sign. The constraint eliminates "the badge said 3 credits but it charged 12!" support tickets entirely. Cost: every route handler now does the chunking math BEFORE spendCredits, not after.

### Decision: Gap #2 cap default OFF, env-flag activation

Originally I'd designed Gap #2 to ship enabled by default. The founder asked for "feature-flagged default OFF" so we could observe the cap's friction profile in prod before fully committing. This turned out to be exactly right — when we activated via `BONUS_PER_OP_CAP_ENABLED=true`, the activation was a 30-second env-var change, not a redeploy. Easy to roll back if user friction spikes.

## 5. Decisions that turned out wrong (and got corrected)

### "80% of tools missing first-page preview" framing in the improvement plan

I claimed in the original `TOOL_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` that 88/110 tools were missing the `<UploadedFilePreview>` component. On audit during T1-2 prep, that framing was misleading — most "missing" tools either don't take a PDF as input (generators, image converters), are visual editors that already render the doc on canvas (PageEditorTool consumers), or use grid bases that show thumbnails directly (PageGridTool consumers). The real preview gap was much smaller and lower priority.

**Lesson:** count the relevant cases, not the absolute cases, when scoping plan items.

### CSP fix in `next.config.mjs` was silently irrelevant

When I found the Turnstile-blocked-by-CSP bug, I committed a fix to `next.config.mjs` (commit `383793a`) and was confused when the live CSP didn't reflect it. Turned out the live `.htaccess` on the Hostinger server has `Header always unset Content-Security-Policy` followed by `Header always set Content-Security-Policy "..."` — Apache strips the Next.js header and replaces it with its own.

**Lesson:** the actual production headers come from `.htaccess`, not Next.js. Snapshot at `public/.htaccess.prod-snapshot` makes this visible to future maintainers.

### O-vs-0 confusion on Cloudflare Turnstile keys

The Turnstile keys use a mix of letter `O` and digit `0` after `0x4AAAAAA`. I was wrong about which character was which in two different messages during the activation walk-through. The Cloudflare dashboard is the source of truth — checking it directly resolved the ambiguity.

**Lesson:** for case-sensitive secrets, paste from source — never re-type or assume from chat-rendered text.

## 6. Items deferred (and why)

These would have been valuable but were either out-of-scope, blocked by external vendors, or required design decisions:

- **T2-1: Real PDF Compress tool** — needs server-side qpdf + ghostscript pipeline (~5 days). Tracked in `docs/TOOL_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`.
- **T1-5: Annual pricing + enterprise CTA** — small code change, but hits the cascade pattern; deferred to next session for batch with other UX changes.
- **T1-6: Plus CTA on OutOfCreditsAlert** — same as T1-5.
- **T3-1: Bulk processing pipeline** — multi-week strategic project.
- **T3-2: API + developer tier** — multi-week strategic project.
- **Paddle KYC** — external vendor blocked (3-7 day SLA at Paddle).
- **Per-op cap admin observability** — log emit when `checkPerOpBonusCap` returns capped:true. Worth doing in the first 2 weeks after Gap #2 activation if friction shows up.
- **Cascade-pattern investigation** — controlled experiment to confirm webpack-cache-invalidation hypothesis. Now well-validated empirically (10 events) so the experiment is lower priority.

## 7. Numbers

- **Session length:** multiple chat sessions across 2026-05-03 → 2026-05-04
- **Commits shipped:** 28 (since context compaction earlier this session)
- **Code-side gaps closed:** 5 of 5 from the post-plan audit
- **Plan items shipped:** 7 (Gap #1-#5 + T1-1 + T1-3 + T2-5 + compress cleanup follow-up)
- **CI guards added:** 4 new (csp-turnstile, gap4-gap5, per-op-bonus-cap, cap-exceeded-wireup) + extensions to `abuse-prevention`
- **Cascades survived:** 10 (cascade-pattern fully validated)
- **Auto-pull jams resolved:** 5 (empty-commit nudge always recovered)
- **Test surface:** 4696 / 4696 across 79 suites
- **Live commit at session end:** `b15a64f7359a` (compress deeper-cleanup) → `f7cb088` queued
- **Production activation status:** all env vars set, all crons scheduled, abuse stack live, Gap #2 cap active, CSP-Turnstile gap fixed, first margin rollup captured at 81.6%

## 8. For the next session

See `docs/NEXT_SESSION.md` for ranked handoff. Three classes of remaining work:

1. **User-action only (no Claude work needed):** activations are done; nothing left.
2. **Investigation:** cascade-pattern hypothesis is now validated empirically; the controlled experiment is optional.
3. **Plan items remaining:** see `docs/TOOL_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` Tier 1/2/3 — pick by acquisition data when we have it.

The codebase is in the cleanest state of the entire arc. Documentation trail is complete. Production is fully active. Anyone picking up the next session should start with `CLAUDE.md` (bootstrap) → `docs/STATUS.md` (timeline) → `docs/NEXT_SESSION.md` (ranked next steps).

### Major milestones reached

**100% AI usage instrumentation.** Started at 20% (only chat + summarize); ended at 100% (all 10 ops). 80-percentage-point swing in this arc. /admin/margin sees 100% of AI fleet for the first time. Per-op error rates measurable across the board. /app/usage per-op breakdown accurate for every tool.

**FeedbackChip data flywheel structurally complete.** 8 of 10 markdown-rendering AI tools have the chip wired (summarize, translate, rewrite, ocr, table, compare, sign, redact). Generate (PDF base64 UX) + chat (conversational UX) deferred for separate UX-shape decisions.

**§11a closed — last documented correctness issue gone.** Webhook audit-row ordering inverted: applyPaymentEvent FIRST, then recordWebhookEvent. Failure path now skips audit insert → next retry actually re-runs the processor. Reconcile sweep was the safety net before; now the handler itself is correct.

**3 new admin surfaces:**
- `/admin/contact-submissions` — sales-qualified-lead reader (PENDING §4c orphan TODO closed)
- `/admin/ai-feedback` — per-op NPS + recent thumbs-down rows (PENDING §6b foundation)
- (existing /admin/margin gains 100% fleet visibility for the first time)

**8 new CI guards:**
- `csp-turnstile` (4) — Cloudflare Turnstile origin allowlist
- `cap-exceeded-wireup` (77) — capExceeded flag through 4-layer chain
- `enterprise-and-plus-cta` (25) — T1-6 OutOfCreditsAlert + /enterprise wire-up
- `cookie-banner-prominence` (15) — GDPR equal-prominence
- `contact-persistence` (46) — contact form persist + admin viewer
- `ai-feedback-foundation` (63) — schema + persist + admin viewer
- `ai-feedback-pilot` (33→42→...) — chip wire-up SSOT
- `ai-usage-instrumentation` (48→64) — recordAiUsage SSOT
- `webhook-reconcile-resilience` (23→25) — 500/200/400 contract + idempotency keys

**Test surface growth:** 4619 → 4988 (+369 assertions, 80% growth driven by new infrastructure guards).

### Cascade pattern data (hard-won)

**Cascades survived: 14 → 18 (+5 in this continuation).** Recovery time has stabilized but spans a wide range:
- Cascade #13 (T2-5 chain): 25 min
- Cascade #14 (doc-only): 12 min
- Cascade #15 (Batch 1): 5 min
- Cascade #16 (jam #10 multi-step): ~12 min + 3 nudges
- Cascade #17 (Batch 3): 8 min via "wait for kernel drain"
- Cascade #18 (§11a fix): **~50 min — worst-case path**

**Hypothesis revisions documented:**
1. Earlier: "doc-only commits don't cascade" → DISPROVEN (cascade #14 hit a doc-only commit)
2. Later: "smaller commit scopes correlate with cascade-free deploys" → PARTIALLY HOLDS (1 of 3 small commits cascaded; not deterministic)
3. Latest: cgroup pressure at push time is the dominant factor; ANY push can trigger a hard cascade if the kernel is already near saturation. Recovery playbook is the constant.

**Recovery playbook validated** across all 5 new cascades:
- Empty-commit nudge resolves auto-pull jams (10/10 success)
- Documented `awk | xargs kill -KILL` pattern is the reliable mass-kill (replaces the less-reliable `pkill -9` in some cases)
- "Wait 5-10 min for kernel drain" extends to "wait 25 min" in worst-case (cascade #18)
- The playbook holds; just slower under saturation

### What remains (revised)

The §11a fix closes the last documented correctness issue. Remaining work is genuinely forward-looking:
- Generate FeedbackChip wire-up (PDF base64 UX)
- Chat FeedbackChip wire-up (conversational UX)
- Stage 3 Batch B (SummarizeVariantTool family, ~9 variants sharing a single component)
- Stage 3 Batch C (specialist + tail tools, ~30+)
- Per-user negative feedback signal (PENDING §6c — depends on chip data accumulating)
- Real PDF Compress (PENDING T2-1, ~5 days)
- Mobile UI hardening (PENDING T1-4, 3-5 days)
- GST invoice generation (PENDING §1a, founder + CA dependency)

The infrastructure groundwork is structurally complete. Future work plugs into existing surfaces (ai_feedback / ai_usage / admin pages) rather than building new ones.

### Aggregator endpoint state

**4988/0 across 86 suites in ~7s.** All green; no skipped suites; no flakes observed across the arc.

---

## §10. Session-continuation extension (2026-05-04 late-night → 2026-05-05 early)

This appendix captures lessons from the multi-turn continuation that followed the original 28-commit arc. **Aggregator state at the start of the extension: 4988/86. State at this writing: 5190/90 (+202 assertions, +4 suites)** across 7 substantial code commits + multiple doc retrospectives.

### What shipped (extension)

- `cb013ab` — Chat FeedbackChip wire-up (10/10 AI ops milestone)
- `76a0c82` — Dunning persistence foundation (PENDING §4c closed) — migration 0023, schema, persist helpers, /admin/dunning, 59-assertion CI guard
- `cda2eae` — Stage 3 batch B chip rollout (4 shared variant runners → ~36 depth variants inherit chip)
- `2a459f3` — Stage 3 batch C chip rollout (5 specialist tools — chip rollout 100% on AI-using components: 19/19)
- `81087df` — Per-user quality-signal foundation (PENDING §6c closed) — pure classifier + read helpers + /admin/quality-signals, 39-assertion CI guard
- `36821aa` — Operational Slack alert helper (PENDING §2a + §2b foundation) — codebase's first dynamic-execution CI guard, 42 assertions
- `b4e382b` — margin-rollup → shared Slack helper migration (first consumer of §2a foundation) — 26-assertion separate guard for clean attribution

Plus 6+ doc-only retrospective commits keeping STATUS.md / NEXT_SESSION.md / PENDING_WORK_ANALYSIS.md current.

### Lesson 1 — the "foundation now, automation later" pattern

The arc shipped 4 different foundations following the same 4-step recipe. Each pattern instance:

1. **Schema or pure-helper module lands** with a CI guard locking in the contract.
2. **Read-side helper or admin page** consumes the contract — empty-by-design today, ready for real data tomorrow.
3. **Automation layer is gated** with a `TODO(automation)` marker explaining what it needs to ship safely.
4. **First consumer migration follows in a SEPARATE commit** (when applicable) with its own CI guard — keeps failure attribution clean.

| Foundation | Commit | Ships | Gates | First consumer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ai-feedback | `d74fefe` (earlier) | table + persist endpoint + /admin/ai-feedback | chip wire-up | `cb013ab` (chat — 10/10) |
| dunning | `76a0c82` | table + persist + /admin/dunning | webhook events on recurring SKUs | (Phase E) |
| quality-signal | `81087df` | classifier + read helpers + /admin/quality-signals | accumulated chip data + threshold tuning | (1-2 weeks of data) |
| slack-alert | `36821aa` | helper module + dynamic-exec guard | webhook URL env var | `b4e382b` (margin-rollup) |

**The pattern works because** each foundation surface is independently useful from day 1 (admin page renders, helper compiles, guard catches regressions) AND because the gate condition is well-defined (env var set, data accumulated, recurring SKU added). Future Claude sessions reading this should reach for the same pattern when they see TODO markers that depend on operational state changes.

### Lesson 2 — separate CI guards per consumer migration

`b4e382b` (margin-rollup migration) ships its own 26-assertion CI guard SEPARATE from the foundation's 45-assertion guard rather than extending it. Rationale: when the aggregator fails in CI, the suite name tells you where the regression lives.

- `slack-alert-foundation` failure → helper API broke (every consumer affected)
- `margin-rollup-slack-migration` failure → margin-rollup's call-site broke (other consumers fine)

This costs ~50 lines of duplicated test scaffolding per migration. It's worth it because: future migrations of `dunning` or `quality-signal` to consume the same helper will add their own guards under the same naming convention (`<consumer>-slack-migration`), and a "clean fail attribution per consumer" guarantee scales to N migrations without crowding the foundation suite.

### Lesson 3 — dynamic-execution CI guards (the slack-alert breakthrough)

Every prior CI guard in `scripts/test-*.mjs` was static-parse only — read source as text, regex for patterns. `slack-alert-foundation` is the codebase's **first dynamic-execution guard**. Section B extracts the `formatSlackPayload` function body + its color/emoji map dependencies via regex, strips TS-only syntax (Record<...>, type unions, return-type annotations) into a JS subset, compiles via `new Function()`, and runs canonical inputs through the real formatter.

This catches bugs that static-parse misses:
- Boundary-off-by-one: `>` vs `>=` on a threshold check.
- Color/emoji map drift: a refactor that moves entries between maps but forgets one severity.
- Number→string coercion: a numeric context value that should render as `"3"` but renders as `3` (Slack rejects non-string field values).
- Truncation: a 500-char value that should cap at 200 chars.

The TS-strip regex pass is approximate but works for the simple TS subset used in pure helper modules. It would NOT work for files that use generics deeply, decorators, namespace declarations, or other complex features. Useful pattern: keep dynamic-execution guards scoped to small pure-helper files.

### Lesson 4 — empirical cgroup pattern

Across this extension, **4 consecutive clean foundation/follow-up deploys** (`81087df` → `36821aa` → `f08b520` → `b4e382b`) confirmed an empirical pattern from the original arc: foundation/migration commits without new migrations or many tool components are reliably cgroup-safe.

**Cascade-prone commits this extension:**
- `cda2eae` (batch B chip rollout — 4 component edits): clean deploy, but auto-pull lag of ~10 min
- `2a459f3` (batch C chip rollout — 5 component edits): cascade #21, single-mass-kill recovered ~3 min
- `76a0c82` (dunning foundation — new migration + new admin page): cascade #20, single-mass-kill recovered ~3 min

**Cascade-clean commits:**
- `cb013ab` (chat chip — single component + route reorder): clean
- `81087df` (quality-signal — pure helper + admin page, no migration): clean
- `36821aa` (slack-alert — pure helper + CI guard, no admin page): clean
- `b4e382b` (margin-rollup migration — single function refactor): clean

**Hypothesis (now stronger):** the dominant cascade trigger is the COMBINATION of (a) new schema migration applied to prod, (b) new admin page registered, (c) >5 component edits. Any one of those alone is usually fine; the combination puts cgroup pressure during Passenger respawn that triggers a cascade in ~50% of deploys. Foundation commits avoid all 3 by design.

### Lesson 5 — auto-pull lag is a separate failure mode from cascades

Earlier in this extension, `76a0c82` had an auto-pull jam that didn't clear via empty-commit nudge for ~25 min. Eventually 2 nudges + waiting ~10 min cleared it. Then `cda2eae` had a different ~10-min auto-pull lag that resolved on its own without nudging.

These are different failure modes:
- **Cascade**: 503 from origin; LSAPI workers thrashing; needs SSH pkick or hPanel restart.
- **Auto-pull lag**: 200 from origin (older commit deployed); next commit on main waiting for Hostinger's GitHub App webhook to fire; eventually self-resolves; nudge SOMETIMES helps, often doesn't.

**Recommended response for auto-pull lag:** wait 15 min before any action; only nudge if the queued commit blocks something time-sensitive. Multiple rapid nudges have NEVER demonstrably improved auto-pull pickup speed in any cascade observed across the arc.

### Lesson 6 — write the guard before the doc retrospective

A pattern that emerged: code commit → CI guard verifies it → doc retrospective references the guard. Reverse order tempting (doc the lesson learned first, then add the guard) but sequencing forward catches a class of "doc says X but code says Y" drift bugs at write-time. The guard is the executable spec; the doc is the human-readable summary.

### Closing state at extension end

- **Aggregator: 5190/90 in ~5.5s** (was 4988/86 at start)
- **`tsc --noEmit` exit 0**
- **21 cascades survived total** across the entire arc (recovery playbook held under all conditions including the 50-min worst-case fork-saturation event)
- **PENDING items closed in the extension:** §11a (webhook ordering), §4c (dunning), §6c (quality-signal), §2a + §2b (slack helper + first consumer)
- **FeedbackChip rollout: 100%** on AI-using components (19/19)
- **What remains:** founder action (set webhook URL env var); multi-day product work (mobile UI hardening, real PDF Compress, edit text in PDFs, bulk processing). Every infrastructure foundation is structurally complete on the code side.

# pdfcraftai — master plan index

**Date:** 2026-04-20 (consolidation pass). **Purpose:** one door into every active planning document. Anyone picking up this project reads this file first, then the specific plan for the work they're doing.

---

## 1. The plan, in 90 seconds

**Product:** pdfcraftai.com — Next.js 14 SaaS on Hostinger. 10 AI-powered PDF tools (chat, summarize, translate, OCR, compare, rewrite, table, redact, generate, sign) charged in credits. Credits sold in four packs: Starter $5 / Creator $19 / Pro $59 / Studio $149.

**Revenue pipeline we're building:**

**Target go-live:** ~2026-05-17 (AI zero-leak bar + Payments Phase 1 webhooks).

**Critical unknowns still blocking:**
1. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not on Hostinger (task #72) — every AI call 503s today.
2. Razorpay KYC in progress, PayPal business account not yet created (task #81).
3. Six founder decisions open (see §4).

## 3. Architecture in one picture — the portability bar

Everything below is tested against one rule: **adding a new provider (payment or AI) must touch ≤ 7 files, zero changes in route handlers, zero changes in UI.**

```
 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │  Routes (app/api/*)                                                 │

                       Normalized webhook event / ChatChunk stream (no SDK types leak past this line)
                              │
                              ▼
                    credit_ledger (+/- delta, idempotencyKey)
                    ai_usage (tokens, cost_usd_micro, key_source)
```

**Why this shape survives a gateway change:**
- Internal payment UUID (`internalPaymentId`) is the portability anchor. Razorpay's `order_id` and PayPal's `resource_id` are stored for lookup, but the ledger uses the internal ID. Migrating gateways is: new adapter, cutover checkout routing. Zero existing-user data changes.
- `AIProviderId` is an open string type. Adding Gemini = 7 files (per master plan §9). Adding Mistral after that = same 7 files.

## 4. Open decisions requiring founder sign-off

These six are blocking the public pricing copy and the A2/A3 builds:

| # | Decision | Recommendation | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Keep Starter pack at $5 or raise to $7? | **Raise to $7.** Scenario S7 shows $5 can't absorb $1.50/mo support cost — margin collapses to 59%. | Pricing page copy; Payments Phase 1 |
| D2 | Ship Anthropic + OpenAI + Gemini keys on day one? | **Yes, all three.** Chat-whale scenario (S3) pushes Pro to −12.5% without cheap routing. Cost to provision: $0. | Phase A0 |
| D3 | BYOK on Pro at launch or defer to week +2? | **Defer.** Remove "+15% infra fee" bullet from `lib/pricing.ts:60` until A3 lands. | `lib/pricing.ts` edit; Payments Phase 1 |
| D4 | Context-token cap on `chat_turn`? | **20k input tokens (~12 pages).** Larger → redirect to `summarize`. | Phase A2 |
| D5 | Free-tier credit count + routing? | **10 credits, force Gemini Flash.** Reduces abuse cost 43×. | Phase A2 |
| D6 | Public margin copy before A4 green? | **"Up to 88%" wording.** Revisit after 7 consecutive daily-rollup green days. | Pricing page deploy |

All six are tracked in task [#87](#) with individual action items.

---

## 5. Phase timeline — one chart

Assuming D1–D6 resolve this week and Razorpay KYC clears by 2026-04-25:

| Week | Phase | Output |
|---|---|---|
| W0 (now — 04-20) | Planning complete | This doc + AI_API_MASTER_PLAN + PAYMENT_GATEWAY_PLAN + MARGIN_VERIFICATION — all committed |
| W1 (04-21 — 04-27) | Payments Phase 0 + AI Phase A0 | KYC docs, legal pages, GSTIN, PayPal business; ANTHROPIC/OPENAI/GEMINI keys on Hostinger; `margin:` field + pricing copy fixed |
| W2 (04-28 — 05-04) | Payments Phase 1 + AI Phase A1 | Webhook routes + checkout UI with per-pack processor policy; `ai_usage` table + `withCreditSpend`; spend-race fix |
| W3 (05-05 — 05-11) | AI Phase A2 | Rate limits + body guards + **context-token cap** + **Gemini adapter** + **router.ts with cheap routing** |
| W4 (05-12 — 05-17) | AI Phase A3 (BYOK) | `user_api_keys` table, `lib/ai/byok/keystore.ts`, `/app/api-keys` UI, Pro/Studio paths |
| W5 (05-18 — 05-21) | AI Phase A4 | Daily margin rollup cron, `/admin/ai-spend` page, per-provider cost dashboard |
| W5+ | GA readiness | 7 consecutive green days on margin rollup before "up to" copy becomes flat claim |

**Zero-leak bar:** hit when every row in §12 of AI_API_MASTER_PLAN.md's definition-of-done turns green. Planned for 2026-05-21.

## 6. Task list pointer

Active tasks tracked in the cowork task manager (not a repo file — it's the shared state):

| Task # | Owns | Status |
|---|---|---|
| #72 | Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to Hostinger env | PENDING (SEV-1) |
| #80 | Payments Phase 1: webhooks + checkout + shared handleWebhook | PENDING, blocked by #81, #82 |
| #81 | Phase 0 legal: KYC + GSTIN + LUT + PayPal business + legal pages | PENDING |
| #82 | Answer PAYMENT_GATEWAY_PLAN.md §10 Q1–Q7 | PENDING |
| #83 | AI Phase A1: `ai_usage` + `withCreditSpend` + fix spend race | PENDING, blocked by #72 |
| #84 | AI Phase A2: rate limits + body guards + **Gemini adapter** + **router.ts** + **context-token cap** + **per-pack checkout** | PENDING, blocked by #83 |
| #85 | AI Phase A3: BYOK (keystore + router + `/api-keys` UI) | PENDING, blocked by #80, #84 |
| #86 | AI Phase A4: margin reporting | PENDING, blocked by #83 |
| #87 | Close margin-leak gaps (6 code fixes + 6 founder decisions) | PENDING, blocks public pricing copy |

---

## 7. What "done" looks like

The site is ready to take real revenue when **all eight** of these are green simultaneously:

1. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `GEMINI_API_KEY` present on Hostinger; `/api/health` reports `ai.configured = true`.
2. Razorpay merchant live + PayPal business account approved; checkout UI shows per-pack gateway routing.
3. At least one end-to-end purchase → credit grant → AI call → `ai_usage` row, verified on the test account.
4. `SUM(credit_ledger.delta) = credits.balance` invariant passes for 100% of users on nightly check.
5. Phase A2 context-token cap enforced (try to send 50k tokens to `chat_turn` → 413).
6. `lib/ai/router.ts` routes OCR and translate to Gemini, chat to GPT-4o-mini, generate/sign to Sonnet (verified by `ai_usage.model` distribution on staging).
7. Daily margin rollup has run 7 consecutive days without breaching the per-op floor set in `PROVIDER_STRATEGY.md`.
8. Public pricing page displays "up to 88% / 83% / 78% / 73%" (never flat-claimed), and Starter either reads $7 or has self-serve-only support copy.

Until all eight are green, the site is **not** ready to advertise the full margin claim or take high-volume traffic.

## 9. How to use this doc

**Starting a new session:**
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` (credentials + infra IDs).
2. Read `docs/STATUS.md` (live punch list).
3. Read this file.
4. Read the specific plan for the work you're doing.

**Making a planning change:**
1. Edit the relevant plan doc.
2. Update this file if the change affects the phase timeline, the decision list, or the "done" definition.
3. Commit both together so future sessions see a consistent picture.

**Presenting to founders:**
- §1, §4, §5, §7 are the four sections most suitable for a 5-minute standup.
- §3 is the architecture diagram if asked "is this portable?"
- §4 is the decision list that needs their sign-off to unblock the team.

*This file is the durable consolidation of every planning decision made in the 2026-04-20 planning sprint. Everything in it is traceable to a commit in `main`; nothing is aspirational.*

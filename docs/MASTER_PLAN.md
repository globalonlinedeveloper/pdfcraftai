# pdfcraftai — master plan index

**Date:** 2026-04-20 (consolidation pass — v4, Phase-0 foundation merge: Paddle MoR + GST + TAX + GEO). **Purpose:** one door into every active planning document. Anyone picking up this project reads this file first, then the specific plan for the work they're doing.

---

## 1. The plan, in 90 seconds

**Product:** pdfcraftai.com — Next.js 14 SaaS on Hostinger. 10 AI-powered PDF tools (chat, summarize, translate, OCR, compare, rewrite, table, redact, generate, sign) charged in credits. Credits sold in four packs: Starter $5 / Creator $19 / Pro $59 / Studio $149.

**Revenue pipeline we're building:**

```

**Target go-live:** ~2026-05-17 (AI zero-leak bar + Payments Phase 1 webhooks).

**Critical unknowns still blocking:**
1. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not on Hostinger (task #72) — every AI call 503s today.
2. Razorpay KYC in progress, **Paddle** KYC not yet started (task #81; PayPal deprecated by D4 resolution — see below).
3. **Ten** founder decisions open (see §4) — D1–D6 on pricing/margin + D7–D9 on cost guardrails + **D12** on transparency. **D10 (EU defer) and D11 (US allow via Paddle MoR) are now CLOSED** via `docs/GEO_LAUNCH_POLICY.md`. **D4 (payment stack)** is now **CLOSED** — Razorpay + Paddle per `docs/payments/MOR_EVALUATION.md`.
4. **11 SEV-0 gaps** identified in PLAN_GAP_ANALYSIS.md must be closed before public launch — including prompt-injection defense, chargeback clawback handling, refund/ToS pages, cookie banner, webhook retry storm, output moderation, malware scan on uploads. **T2-G1 (India GST) and T2-G2 (EU VAT) now have documented remediation plans** in `docs/india/GST_SETUP.md` and `docs/GEO_LAUNCH_POLICY.md` respectively.

**Loss-bounding guarantees added 2026-04-20:** See `COST_GUARDRAILS.md`. A 500-page PDF × 10-turn Sonnet chat goes from −$7.23/session loss to either bounded positive margin or forced BYOK. Max per-turn cost is mathematically capped by Layer 1 (20k input-token gate).

**Gap-analysis audit added 2026-04-20:** See `PLAN_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`. 42 previously-unmapped scenarios across adversarial, regulatory, operational, product, and financial axes — classified SEV-0..SEV-3 and fed back into phase scoping.

**Phase 0 foundation docs added 2026-04-20:** Four docs closing the payments + geography + tax + GST compliance arc:
- `docs/payments/MOR_EVALUATION.md` — Paddle chosen as international MoR over Lemon Squeezy, FastSpring, Paypro Global, Gumroad, DodoPayments. Razorpay remains on the IN rail. 6-vendor weighted scoring + sandbox validation plan + Plan B/C fallbacks.
- `docs/GEO_LAUNCH_POLICY.md` — Tier 1 (allow: IN + US + UK + CA + AU + NZ + SG + UAE + rest of APAC + LatAm + MEA), Tier 2 (defer: EU + CH + NO + IS + LI + CN + RU + BY), Tier 3 (block: OFAC-sanctioned). Cloudflare WAF + checkout-gate implementation.
- `docs/india/TAX_MODEL.md` — 3-regime comparison (44ADA / 44AD / regular books), net-take-home scenarios at $50k / $100k / $250k ARR, multi-year regime-transition roadmap, 7 CA-confirmation questions.
- `docs/india/GST_SETUP.md` — GSTIN registration runbook, LUT filing, HSN/SAC 998313, invoice templates for IN + export rails, monthly GSTR-1/3B calendar, CA artefact checklist.

These four resolve D4, D10, D11, and provide the Phase 0 legal runbook that was previously enumerated but not documented.

## 3. Architecture in one picture — the portability bar

Everything below is tested against one rule: **adding a new provider (payment or AI) must touch ≤ 7 files, zero changes in route handlers, zero changes in UI.**

```

                    ai_usage (tokens, cost_usd_micro, key_source)
```

**Why this shape survives a gateway change:**
- Internal payment UUID (`internalPaymentId`) is the portability anchor. Razorpay's `order_id` and PayPal's `resource_id` are stored for lookup, but the ledger uses the internal ID. Migrating gateways is: new adapter, cutover checkout routing. Zero existing-user data changes.
- `AIProviderId` is an open string type. Adding Gemini = 7 files (per master plan §9). Adding Mistral after that = same 7 files.

---

## 4. Open decisions requiring founder sign-off

These twelve decisions are blocking the public pricing copy, the A2/A3 builds, and the launch geo-scope:

| # | Decision | Recommendation | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Keep Starter pack at $5 or raise to $7? | **Raise to $7.** Scenario S7 shows $5 can't absorb $1.50/mo support cost — margin collapses to 59%. | Pricing page copy; Payments Phase 1 |
| D2 | Ship Anthropic + OpenAI + Gemini keys on day one? | **Yes, all three.** Chat-whale scenario (S3) pushes Pro to −12.5% without cheap routing. Cost to provision: $0. | Phase A0 |
| D3 | BYOK on Pro at launch or defer to week +2? | **Defer.** Remove "+15% infra fee" bullet from `lib/pricing.ts:60` until A3 lands. | `lib/pricing.ts` edit; Payments Phase 1 |
| D4 | Context-token cap on `chat_turn`? | **20k input tokens (~12 pages).** Larger → redirect to `summarize`. | Phase A2 |
| D5 | Free-tier credit count + routing? | **10 credits, force Gemini Flash.** Reduces abuse cost 43×. | Phase A2 |
| D6 | Public margin copy before A4 green? | **"Up to 88%" wording.** Revisit after 7 consecutive daily-rollup green days. | Pricing page deploy |
| D7 | `MAX_CREDITS_PER_TURN` cap value? | **10 credits (= $0.50 revenue ceiling).** Covers Haiku 100k-token turn; bounds estimate-miss risk. | Phase A2 (Layer 5 reconciliation) |
| D8 | Margin threshold that auto-flips user to BYOK-required? | **30%** — any user whose 24-hour spend exceeds 70% of their revenue gets moved to BYOK-only. Chronic whales stop costing the platform within 24 hours. | Phase A4 (Layer 7 circuit breaker) |
| D9 | Trigger threshold for pre-send cost confirmation UI? | **≥ 2 credits** — silent for normal 1-credit turns, explicit confirmation for anything larger. | Phase A2 (Layer 4) |
| D10 | ~~Serve EU customers at launch?~~ | **CLOSED 2026-04-20 → GEO_LAUNCH_POLICY.md** — Geo-block EU (Tier 2 defer) until MRR > $5k. | Phase 0 legal; checkout geo-gate |
| D11 | ~~Serve US customers at launch (risk of sales-tax nexus)?~~ | **CLOSED 2026-04-20 → GEO_LAUNCH_POLICY.md + MOR_EVALUATION.md** — Geo-allow US via Paddle MoR. Paddle handles 50-state sales tax registration + remittance, so nexus is Paddle's problem, not ours. | Phase 0 legal; monitoring dashboard |
| D12 | Publish which model handled each request? | **No.** Disclose provider list generically in ToS ("we route across Anthropic, OpenAI, Google"), but hide per-call model in UI. Protects router.ts as trade secret; users see "AI-powered" not "GPT-4o-mini answered this". | Phase A2 UI; privacy policy |

**Also newly closed 2026-04-20:**

| # | Decision | Resolution | Closed in |
|---|---|---|---|
| D4 | Payment stack for international customers | **CLOSED → Razorpay (IN) + Paddle (RoW).** Paddle was picked over Lemon Squeezy, FastSpring, Paypro Global, Gumroad, Dodo based on India-payout reliability + subscription-feature maturity + tax-jurisdiction coverage. PayPal dropped from plan. | `docs/payments/MOR_EVALUATION.md` |

D1–D6 tracked in task [#87](#). D7–D9 added 2026-04-20 from `COST_GUARDRAILS.md` §8 — they gate Phase A2 Layer 1/3/5/7 implementation. D10–D12 added 2026-04-20 from `PLAN_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` §6; **D10 + D11 closed same day** via GEO_LAUNCH_POLICY.md. D4 reframed and **closed same day** via MOR_EVALUATION.md. Remaining open: D1, D2, D3, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D12 (nine decisions).

## 5. Phase timeline — one chart

Assuming D1–D6 resolve this week and Razorpay KYC clears by 2026-04-25:

| Week | Phase | Output |
|---|---|---|
| W0 (now — 04-20) | Planning complete | This doc + AI_API_MASTER_PLAN + PAYMENT_GATEWAY_PLAN + MARGIN_VERIFICATION — all committed |
| W1 (04-21 — 04-27) | Payments Phase 0 + AI Phase A0 | KYC docs, legal pages, GSTIN, PayPal business; ANTHROPIC/OPENAI/GEMINI keys on Hostinger; `margin:` field + pricing copy fixed |
| W2 (04-28 — 05-04) | Payments Phase 1 + AI Phase A1 | Webhook routes + checkout UI with per-pack processor policy; `ai_usage` table + `withCreditSpend`; spend-race fix |
| W3 (05-05 — 05-11) | AI Phase A2 | Rate limits + body guards + **context-token cap (Layer 1)** + **Gemini adapter + router.ts (Layer 6)** + **dynamic credit multiplier (Layer 3)** + **pre-send confirmation UI (Layer 4)** + **post-hoc reconcile (Layer 5)** + **streaming early-stop (Layer 8)** + **doc-ops /summarize-document (Layer 10)** — see COST_GUARDRAILS.md |
| W4 (05-12 — 05-17) | AI Phase A3 (BYOK) | `user_api_keys` table, `lib/ai/byok/keystore.ts`, `/app/api-keys` UI, Pro/Studio paths |
| W5 (05-18 — 05-21) | AI Phase A4 | Daily margin rollup cron, `/admin/ai-spend` page, per-provider cost dashboard, **per-user margin circuit breaker (Layer 7)**, **provider invoice reconcile** |
| W5+ | GA readiness | 7 consecutive green days on margin rollup before "up to" copy becomes flat claim |

**Zero-leak bar:** hit when every row in §12 of AI_API_MASTER_PLAN.md's definition-of-done turns green. Planned for 2026-05-21.

## 6. Task list pointer

Active tasks tracked in the cowork task manager (not a repo file — it's the shared state):

| Task # | Owns | Status |
|---|---|---|
| #72 | Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to Hostinger env | PENDING (SEV-1) |
| #80 | Payments Phase 1: webhooks + checkout + shared handleWebhook | PENDING, blocked by #81, #82 |
| #81 | Phase 0 legal: KYC + GSTIN + LUT + PayPal business + legal pages | PENDING |
| #82 | Answer PAYMENT_GATEWAY_PLAN.md §10 Q1–Q7 | PENDING |
| #83 | AI Phase A1: `ai_usage` + `withCreditSpend` + fix spend race | PENDING, blocked by #72 |
| #84 | AI Phase A2: rate limits + body guards + **Gemini adapter** + **router.ts** + **context-token cap** + **per-pack checkout** | PENDING, blocked by #83 |
| #85 | AI Phase A3: BYOK (keystore + router + `/api-keys` UI) | PENDING, blocked by #80, #84 |
| #86 | AI Phase A4: margin reporting | PENDING, blocked by #83 |
| #87 | Close margin-leak gaps (6 code fixes + 6 founder decisions) | PENDING, blocks public pricing copy |

---

## 7. What "done" looks like

The site is ready to take real revenue when **all eight** of these are green simultaneously:

1. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `GEMINI_API_KEY` present on Hostinger; `/api/health` reports `ai.configured = true`.
2. Razorpay merchant live + PayPal business account approved; checkout UI shows per-pack gateway routing.
3. At least one end-to-end purchase → credit grant → AI call → `ai_usage` row, verified on the test account.
4. `SUM(credit_ledger.delta) = credits.balance` invariant passes for 100% of users on nightly check.
5. Phase A2 context-token cap enforced (try to send 50k tokens to `chat_turn` → 413).
6. `lib/ai/router.ts` routes OCR and translate to Gemini, chat to GPT-4o-mini, generate/sign to Sonnet (verified by `ai_usage.model` distribution on staging).
7. Daily margin rollup has run 7 consecutive days without breaching the per-op floor set in `PROVIDER_STRATEGY.md`.
8. Public pricing page displays "up to 88% / 83% / 78% / 73%" (never flat-claimed), and Starter either reads $7 or has self-serve-only support copy.

Until all eight are green, the site is **not** ready to advertise the full margin claim or take high-volume traffic.

3. Read this file.
4. Read the specific plan for the work you're doing.

**Making a planning change:**

2. Update this file if the change affects the phase timeline, the decision list, or the "done" definition.
3. Commit both together so future sessions see a consistent picture.

**Presenting to founders:**
- §1, §4, §5, §7 are the four sections most suitable for a 5-minute standup.
- §3 is the architecture diagram if asked "is this portable?"
- §4 is the decision list that needs their sign-off to unblock the team.

# AI Feedback Rollout — Stage Tracker

PENDING_WORK_ANALYSIS.md §6b ships in three stages. This doc tracks
progress + lays out the rollout plan for the remaining tools.

## Stage 1 — foundation (CLOSED, commit `d74fefe`)

- Migration 0022: `ai_feedback` table
- Drizzle schema entry (`aiFeedback`)
- POST `/api/ai/feedback` (auth-gated, zod-validated, upsert via ON
  DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE, 60/min rate limit)
- `/admin/ai-feedback` page (summary cards + per-op NPS table +
  recent thumbs-down rows)
- Admin layout NAV entry under Ops
- 63-assertion CI guard

## Stage 2 — FeedbackChip + Summarize pilot (IN PROGRESS)

- `components/feedback/FeedbackChip.tsx` (NEW reusable chip)
- `app/api/ai/summarize/route.ts` extended to surface `aiUsageId`
  in both 200 + 207 responses (captured from `recordAiUsage` return)
- `components/tools/SummarizePdfTool.tsx` wires the chip into the
  ResultCard with full provenance (operation, aiUsageId, fileId,
  providerId, model)
- CI guard `ai-feedback-pilot` locks in the wire-up

**Why pilot first:** rolling out the chip across all 53 AI tools in
a single commit would touch 53+ files which cascades the deploy. The
pilot proves the end-to-end loop (POST → row in ai_feedback →
/admin/ai-feedback shows it) on a single high-traffic tool, then
stage 3 batches the rest knowing the chip works.

## Stage 3 — fleet rollout (PENDING)

53 AI tools to wire. Grouped by route category for batched commits
that minimize cascade frequency:

### Batch A — top-5 traffic ops (single commit, ~5 files)

1. `TranslatePdfTool` — `/api/ai/translate` route
2. `RewritePdfTool` — `/api/ai/rewrite` route
3. `TableExtractTool` — `/api/ai/table` route
4. `ComparePdfTool` — `/api/ai/compare` route
5. `OcrPdfTool` — `/api/ai/ocr` route

These are the 5 routes with their own dedicated runner components +
their own POST handlers. Each route needs the same `aiUsageId`
surfacing change, each runner needs the chip wire-up.

### Batch B — variant tools (single commit, ~9 files)

`SummarizeVariantTool` and family (faq / action-items / mindmap /
blood-test / jd-match / paraphrase / detector / rewrite-variant).
These share more code — the parent variant runner can be modified
once and the chip flows through to all variants.

### Batch C — specialist + remaining (final commit, ~30+ files)

The legal / specialist tools (`CourtOrderTool`, `BloodTestTool`,
etc.) plus the long tail. Single commit batched after batches A + B
have validated the pattern.

## What needs to happen at each route

When wiring a new AI route to the chip:

1. **Route handler** (`app/api/ai/<op>/route.ts`):
   - Capture `recordAiUsage` return value:
     `const usageRecord = await recordAiUsage({...});`
   - Add to response body:
     `aiUsageId: usageRecord.applied ? usageRecord.id : null`
   - Add to BOTH the 200 path AND the 207 / persist-failed path.

2. **Runner component** (`components/tools/<X>Tool.tsx`):
   - Import: `import { FeedbackChip } from "@/components/feedback/FeedbackChip"`
   - Result type: add `aiUsageId: string | null` field
   - Response parser: capture `aiUsageId: typeof body.aiUsageId === "string" ? body.aiUsageId : null`
   - ResultCard JSX: add `<FeedbackChip operation="<op>" aiUsageId={result.aiUsageId} fileId={result.fileId ?? null} providerId={result.providerId} model={result.model} />` at the bottom of the card.

3. **CI guard**: extend `test-ai-feedback-pilot.mjs` (rename to
   `test-ai-feedback-rollout.mjs` once batch A lands) to include
   the new tool in the "wired tools" list.

## Edge cases

### Batch ops + chat_turn

Batch ops route through `app/api/ai/batch/submit` → finalize. The
`aiUsageId` here points to the FINALIZED usage row (created during
batch finalize, not at submit time). The chip should still work — it
just attaches feedback to the finalize row.

Chat turns produce no `file_id` and the `aiUsageId` is the chat-turn
row in `ai_usage`. The chip works the same way; the admin page shows
"file_id: null" rather than a clickable file link.

### Re-runs + replays

`recordAiUsage` is idempotent on `idempotencyKey` — a duplicate run
returns `{applied: false, reason: "duplicate"}`. In that case the
route falls through to `aiUsageId: null` and the chip degrades
gracefully (each click inserts a new row instead of flipping). This
is rare (idempotency replay is only triggered by client retry on
network failures) but worth knowing.

### Existing rendered results

Users who already have a Summary card open from before this commit
won't have `aiUsageId` in their result state — the chip will work
but every click is a new row. The next summary they run captures
the id. No data migration needed.

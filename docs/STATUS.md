# pdfcraftai.com — Live Status & Punch List

_Single source of truth for what's done, what's pending, and who owns each item._
_Future Claude sessions: read this AFTER `CLAUDE.md` and BEFORE starting new work._

**Last updated:** 2026-04-20 (post-image-to-pdf + /api/health ship)

## How to use this file

- Anything in **Done** is verified live — don't redo it.
- Anything in **Pending (Claude can do)** is fully automatable from a Cowork session — pick it up.
- Anything in **Pending (needs the user)** requires a human action (DNS console, mailbox check, paid signup, etc.) — don't guess credentials, just remind the user.
- When you finish an item, move it to Done with the date and the verification command/screenshot.

## Done

### Infra

- [x] **Cloudflare proxy in front of Hostinger** — verified via `cf-ray` + `server: cloudflare` on every response. (2026-04-19)
- [x] **Apex + www both serve the app** — both resolve, www redirects to apex. (2026-04-19)

- [x] `/bulk` — Batch-processing landing. (2026-04-20)

### Free tools (client-side WASM)

- [x] **`/tool/page-numbers` runner live.** New `PageNumbersTool` component ships two modes in one runner: (a) **Page numbers** — 4 formats (`1`, `1 / N`, `Page 1`, `Page 1 of N`) × 6 positions (TL/TC/TR/BL/BC/BR), adjustable font size 8–24pt; (b) **Watermark** — user-entered text (≤40 chars) drawn diagonally at 45° across page center, adjustable font size 24–96pt, adjustable opacity 5–60%. Built on `pdf-lib` with `StandardFonts.Helvetica` / `HelveticaBold`; fully client-side, no server round-trip. Wired into `LIVE_TOOL_IDS` in `app/tool/[id]/page.tsx`. Flips T5 in TEST_PLAN.md from Pending → Ready-to-test. (2026-04-20)
- [x] **`/tool/to-pdf` runner live.** New `ImageToPdfTool` component accepts JPG + PNG (≤20 MB each), embeds each image as a page, and saves one PDF. Supports three layout modes: fit-to-image (each page sized to source dimensions, capped at 3000pt), US Letter with centered fit, A4 with centered fit. Adjustable page margin (0–72pt) in Letter/A4 modes. Multi-file reorder + remove controls mirror MergePdfTool. Built on `pdf-lib` `embedJpg` / `embedPng`. Brings the live free-tool count to six. (2026-04-20)

### API / monitoring

- [x] **`/api/health` endpoint shipped.** Pings the DB with `SELECT 1`, returns `{ ok, service, commit, uptimeSec, db: { ok, latencyMs|error }, ts }`. Status code 200 on healthy / 503 on DB failure. `cache-control: no-store` so Cloudflare never serves a stale probe. Consumed by the status page and safe to bind as the Cloudflare origin health check. Error strings sanitized — never echoes DSN fragments. (2026-04-20)

### Legal content audit

- [x] **Privacy + Terms stale-contact audit complete.** Both pages render through `lib/legal-docs.ts` which uses a single `SUPPORT_EMAIL = "support@pdfcraftai.com"` constant. No stray addresses on either page; when the mailbox goes live, the consistent constant makes the cutover a single-line change. (2026-04-20)

### Theme + testing infrastructure

- [x] **Light/dark theme toggle** shipped in TopNav via new `ThemeToggle` component. Uses the existing pre-hydration script in `app/layout.tsx` + `[data-theme]` CSS variables in `globals.css`. Stored in `pdfcraft_state.theme`. (2026-04-20)
- [x] **`docs/TEST_PLAN.md` created** — P0–P6 batches (auth, free tools, AI tools, authed app, marketing/SEO, error/edge cases, a11y/perf). (2026-04-20)
- [x] **`docs/FEATURE_TRACKER.md` created** — Done / Partial / Pending matrix across marketing, auth, API, product, analytics, SEO, security. (2026-04-20)

### Stubs for follow-up email wiring

- [x] **`/api/contact` route** — Zod-validated, in-memory rate-limited, logs submissions until SendGrid/Postmark lands. (2026-04-20)
- [x] **`/api/auth/forgot-password` route** — acks identically on success/miss (anti-enumeration), per-email rate limited, logs for reset-link wiring. `ForgotPasswordForm` now POSTs here instead of the local `setTimeout` mock. (2026-04-20)

### Search engines

- [x] **GSC: sitemap resubmitted.** Property `https://pdfcraftai.com/`. Discovered pages refreshed 59 → 39. (2026-04-20)
- [x] **Bing Webmaster Tools: sitemap resubmitted.** Status moved Success → Processing, last-submit 2026-04-19. URL count will refresh from stale 21 → 39 after re-crawl. (2026-04-20)

### Security / housekeeping

- [x] **Old over-scoped GitHub PAT (`cowork-pdfcraftai-deploy`) deleted.** Had `admin:enterprise, admin:org, delete_repo` etc., expired 2026-05-19. (2026-04-20)
- [x] **Active PAT is `cowork-pdfcraftai-deploy-v2`** — minimal scopes (`repo, workflow, read:network_configurations`), expires 2026-07-18. Stored in `.claude/secrets.env`. (2026-04-20)
- [x] **Hostinger SSH key `cowork-apr2026-v2` active.** Private half at `.claude/id_ed25519_cowork`. (2026-04-19)
- [x] **`.gitignore` covers `.claude/`, `secrets.env`, `id_ed25519*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.pub`.** Synced from local mount into the repo. (2026-04-20)
- [x] **`CLAUDE.md` + `docs/DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.md` + `docs/STATUS.md` versioned in the repo.** Survives sandbox wipes and fresh clones. (2026-04-20)

## Pending (Claude can do — pick these up first)

- [ ] **(quality) Run a Lighthouse / accessibility pass** on home + a few tool pages, surface top-3 fixes.
- [ ] **(SEO) Verify `metadata.openGraph` and `twitter` cards on key pages** — open `https://pdfcraftai.com` in Twitter/Facebook share validators.
- [ ] **(monitoring) Wire Cloudflare origin health check at `/api/health`.** Endpoint is live (see Done above); this is just the last-mile step of pointing CF at it in the dashboard.

---

## Pending (needs the user — Claude cannot complete autonomously)

### Email authentication (only after the user picks an email host)

- [ ] **DMARC TXT record at `_dmarc.pdfcraftai.com`** in Cloudflare DNS. Suggested start: `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@pdfcraftai.com; pct=100; aspf=r; adkim=r`. Move to `p=quarantine` then `p=reject` after a few weeks of clean reports.
- [ ] **Custom DKIM key in Hostinger Email** (or whatever email provider gets chosen). Hostinger generates the key; user pastes the resulting CNAME/TXT into Cloudflare DNS.
- [ ] **SPF TXT record at apex** (`v=spf1 include:_spf.hostinger.com -all` or include the chosen sender's SPF host).
- [ ] **`support@pdfcraftai.com` mailbox.** Confirm it sends + receives end-to-end before swapping it into the Google OAuth contact email.
- [ ] **Transactional sender wired** (Resend / Postmark / Hostinger SMTP) for password resets, magic links, receipts, etc. Needs an account + API key the user creates.

### Manual smoke tests

- [ ] **Google sign-in click-test.** Open `/login` in your browser, click "Continue with Google", complete the round-trip, confirm redirect back to the app and a session cookie is set. Claude can drive `/login` via Chrome MCP but cannot complete the Google account login itself.

### Cloudflare audit (10-item review, when convenient)

- [ ] SSL/TLS mode = Full (strict) confirmed
- [ ] HSTS on (already present in response headers)
- [ ] Always Use HTTPS on
- [ ] Auto Minify on for HTML/CSS/JS
- [ ] Brotli on
- [ ] Bot Fight Mode review (avoid breaking legit API calls)
- [ ] WAF rules: rate-limit `/api/auth/*` to ~10 req/min/IP
- [ ] Page Rules: confirm www → apex 301
- [ ] Email routing for `support@`, `dmarc-reports@` if mail isn't on Hostinger
- [ ] Analytics → confirm Web Analytics is on (free, separate from GA4)

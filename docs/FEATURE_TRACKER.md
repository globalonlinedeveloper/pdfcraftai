# pdfcraftai.com — Feature Tracker

_Structured matrix of every feature area in the product: what's Done, what's Partial, what's Pending._
_Pair this with `STATUS.md` (operational punch list) — this file answers "does the site have X?", STATUS answers "who owns the next step on X?"._

**Last updated:** 2026-04-20 (post-image-to-pdf + /api/health ship)

## Legend

- **Done** — feature is live in production, visually polished, and wired to a real backend (or a privacy-preserving stub that won't embarrass us).
- **Partial** — UI ships, but the backing behavior is stubbed / mocked / disabled behind a flag.
- **Pending** — not built at all, or only a stub route exists.

## How to update this file

1. When you ship a feature, flip its row from Partial/Pending → Done and add a 1-line note (commit SHA, date, or verification evidence).
2. When you discover a new gap, add a row in the right section with Pending status so it doesn't get lost.
3. Keep the wording stable — this file is a source of truth for future audits; don't reword rows without reason.

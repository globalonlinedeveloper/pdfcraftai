// inlines these values at build time; no runtime file reads needed.
//

// deploy path, which checks out the full repo), fall through to `null`
// quietly — health still returns, just without a SHA.

// --- PCI DSS SAQ-A scope lockdown -----------------------------------------
//
// Our SAQ-A eligibility rests on card data NEVER touching our origin.
// Users type card details into hosted iframes (Razorpay Checkout modal).
// The CSP below enforces that architecture at the browser layer:
//
//   - `frame-src` whitelists ONLY the provider iframes. A phishing page
//     embedded elsewhere can't render inside our origin.
//   - `script-src` whitelists provider SDK origins + 'self'. A compromised
//     third-party script cannot inject a fake card form because the new
//     script origin would be blocked.
//   - `connect-src` whitelists provider APIs. If we or an injected script
//     tried to POST card data to a rogue endpoint, the browser blocks it.
//   - `form-action 'self'` — form submits go to our origin only.
//   - `base-uri 'self'` — blocks <base href> injection that could reroute
//     relative URLs to an attacker.
//
// If this file changes in a way that widens `script-src`, `frame-src`, or
// `connect-src`, the PCI checklist in docs/security/pci-saq-a.md must be
// reviewed — adding a new third-party payment-adjacent origin can push us
// out of SAQ-A into a heavier SAQ.
//
// CSP notes:
//   - 'unsafe-inline' on script-src is a concession to Next.js inline
//     script runtime. When Next 15's strict CSP lands we should switch to
//     nonces. For SAQ-A this is acceptable because the card-capture path
//     is *inside* the provider iframe — our inline scripts can't reach it.
//   - 'unsafe-eval' is omitted. The Razorpay SDK doesn't need it.
//   - report-uri is not set yet — add a Sentry CSP endpoint when infra
//     has one.

      // today (commit 205697c) at add-text-box with honest copy
      // downgrade and app/edit-pdf/page.tsx now renders the landing.
      // 2026-05-02: /markdown-to-pdf REDIRECT REMOVED — same bug
      // pattern as text-to-pdf below (caught earlier). Was pointing
      // at /tool/pdf-to-markdown which is the OPPOSITE direction
      // (PDF → Markdown extractor, not Markdown → PDF generator).
      // Real Markdown → PDF tool shipped earlier in the
      // 2026-05-01 Tier 1 batch alongside grayscale + booklet, and
      // an SEO landing for /markdown-to-pdf exists in lib/seo-pages.ts
      // pointing at the correct `tool: "markdown-to-pdf"`. Created
      // app/markdown-to-pdf/page.tsx so the landing renders instead
      // of bouncing through the wrong-direction redirect.
      // 2026-05-01: text-to-pdf is its own tool now (was redirected
      // to /tool/pdf-to-text — the OPPOSITE direction. Bad pre-fix.)
      // 2026-05-02: /extract-emails-from-pdf REDIRECT REMOVED — real
      // tool (extract-contacts) shipped today (commit c56705e) and
      // app/extract-emails-from-pdf/page.tsx now renders the SEO
      // landing.
      // 2026-05-02: /grayscale-pdf REDIRECT REMOVED — real tool
      // shipped earlier in this commit-arc and app/grayscale-pdf/
      // page.tsx now renders the SEO landing.
      // 2026-05-02: /booklet-pdf REDIRECT REMOVED — real tool shipped
      // earlier in this commit-arc and app/booklet-pdf/page.tsx now
      // renders the SEO landing.
      //
      // 2026-04-30 second-pass — close out the 5 "broken-render"
      // landings (originally surfaced by the SEO smoke spec). These
      // five DO have app/<slug>/page.tsx files but their `tool:`
      // field in lib/seo-pages.ts references a tool ID that doesn't
      // exist in lib/tools.ts. SeoLandingPage's `if (!tool) return
      // null;` falls back to the layout's notFound boundary, so the
      // pages return 200 OK with a "this page hasn't been ported
      // yet" body — bad UX, bad SEO.
      //
      // next.config.mjs redirects() runs BEFORE the file-system
      // route matcher, so adding a 308 here intercepts the request
      // before the broken-render path can fire. The dead app/<slug>/
      // page.tsx files become dead code — could be deleted later
      // but the redirect alone fixes the user-visible problem.
      //
      // Destination rationale:
      //   - pdf-to-word/excel/powerpoint: no PDF-to-Office
      //     extraction tool exists; route to /tool/pdf-to-text
      //     (closest extraction tool, preserves the "get content out
      //     of a PDF" intent).
      //   - pdf-to-ics-calendar: no extract-dates tool exists; route
      //     to /tool/pdf-search (text-finding is the closest live
      //     analog).
      //   - court-judgment-summarizer: no ai-court-order tool;
      //     route to /tool/ai-summarize (general PDF summarization
      //     covers the legal-doc summary use case).

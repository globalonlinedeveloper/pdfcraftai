// SEO Ship #4 (2026-04-25): use-case ("job to be done") landing pages.
//
// Why these matter: head-term searches like "merge pdf" are crowded.
// Use-case searches like "combine bank statements for accountant" are
// less crowded and signal MUCH higher intent — the searcher already
// knows what they're trying to accomplish, not just what tool they
// might need. Lower volume per query, but higher conversion per visit.
//
// Editorial principles:
// 1. Lead with the job, not the tool. "How to combine invoices for
//    accounting" reads like a guide, not an ad.
// 2. Map to the SPECIFIC tools you'd chain together. Most jobs need
//    2-3 steps; we have macros for that.
// 3. Be specific about audience. "For your accountant" is sharper
//    than "for business" — and ranks for the term someone actually types.

The second half is relevance: ATS screens rank resumes by how well they match the job description's keywords, so a resume that's readable but doesn't reflect the posting's language still ranks low.

      "A scan that opens sideways is the small annoyance that makes a document look unprofessional and forces every reader to crane their neck or rotate it in their own viewer. Fixing it once, at the source, saves everyone that friction. Rotate corrects 90° orientation problems (the common case when a page goes through the feeder the wrong way), and Crop removes the dark scanner border so the page is just the document. Note the honest limit: Rotate works in 90° steps — it squares up a sideways page, but it doesn't deskew a page scanned at a slight 2° tilt; for that you'd re-scan straight. Because Rotate, Crop, and Compress all run in your browser, sensitive scans — IDs, contracts, statements — never leave your device.",

      "A CSV is built for machines — it opens differently in every spreadsheet app, anyone can quietly edit a cell, and it looks like noise to a non-technical reader. A PDF is built for people and for the record: it renders the same everywhere, it's awkward to alter, and it's what finance, clients, and auditors expect to receive and file. Turning a query result or an account export into a clean tabular PDF makes it shareable and archivable in one step. A practical note: very wide CSVs (lots of columns) can get cramped on a portrait page, so trim to the columns that matter before converting if the table is sprawling. CSV to PDF, Page Numbers, and Merge all run in your browser, so the underlying data never leaves your device.",

Working that out by hand is fiddly and easy to get wrong — one transposed sheet and the whole booklet is scrambled. Booklet does the imposition for you, pairing and ordering the pages two-up for fold-and-staple printing. Add page numbers before imposing so they land on the logical pages, and compress for a fast print run. To print it: use your printer's double-sided setting with short-edge binding, then fold and staple along the spine. Everything runs in your browser, so the document stays on your device.",

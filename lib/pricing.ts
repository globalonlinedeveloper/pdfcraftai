   * Claimed gross margin percentage shown on the /pricing page.
   *
   * IMPORTANT: This number is an AI-cost-only headline figure under
   * "cheap routing" (Gemini Flash for OCR+translate, GPT-4o-mini for
   * chat+rewrite, Haiku for mid-tier, Sonnet for deep-tier). It does
   * NOT yet subtract:
   *   - processor fees (Razorpay INR 2%×1.18 on IN volume;
   *     Paddle MoR 5% + $0.50 on intl volume — per D4, 2026-04-20,
   *     see docs/payments/MOR_EVALUATION.md)
   *   - support cost amortisation (~$0.50–$1.50/paid-user/month)
   *   - refund / chargeback drag
   *   - FX spread on USD→INR payout
   *   - GST or income tax (pass-through, not cost)
   *
   * Actual net margin post-Paddle under realistic ops mix
   * (docs/ai/MARGIN_VERIFICATION.md §12.3 S1):
   *   Starter: 88.5% / Creator: 90.8% / Pro: 90.2% / Studio: 89.3%
   *
   * Until the routing policy + Gemini adapter ship (tasks #80 / A5 in
   * master plan), cheap routing is aspirational and Haiku-all routing
   * hits Starter ~84.7% / Creator ~85.1% / Pro ~82.5% / Studio ~79.9%
   * on realistic mix, dropping sharply under worst-case scenarios
   * (S3 chat whale, S7 support-heavy Starter — see §9 and §12).
   *
   * Public pricing copy MUST read "up to" this % until Phase A4 daily
   * margin rollup shows 7 consecutive green days at claim-or-better.

/**
 * Flat per-operation credit cost. Single number, no metered variant —
 * the user picked "flat per-op cost" in scoping so a 1-credit chat turn
 * is always 1 credit whether the response is 50 tokens or 800.
 *
 * Rationale:
 *   - Predictable for users. They can see the count on every button.
 *   - Implementation simpler: we debit once up front, refund once on
 *     error. No mid-stream proration.
 *   - Cost to us averages out over a day of usage. Token-metered
 *     billing makes sense at scale; for now simplicity wins.
 *
 * If we ever want metered billing, swap the value for a function
 * `(usage) => credits` — the call sites take `AI_OPERATION_COSTS[op]`
 * as-is, so a number→function change is a narrow refactor.

    q: "How is credit cost calculated?",
    a: "Each tool has a base credit cost plus metered usage (pages, output tokens). We always round up to the nearest credit, and we apply a small overhead floor to cover pipeline costs. Exact formula shown before every run.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I bring my own API key?",
    a: "Yes, from the Pro tier. Pro charges a flat 15% infra fee for the orchestration layer (RAG, chunking, retries, caching, audit log). Studio is $49/seat/mo for unlimited BYOK with no per-call fee.",

    q: "What happens to my files?",

    q: "Do you have volume discounts?",
    a: "Yes — accounts spending $500+/mo auto-qualify for Pro pricing. Annual plans save 20%. Enterprise contracts start at $2k/mo.",

    q: "Do you have an API?",
    a: "REST + webhooks, SDKs for JS/Python/Go. Free tier: 200 calls/month. Paid usage metered in credits, same rates as the web app.",

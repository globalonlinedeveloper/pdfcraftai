 * Variant of a credit pack purchase.
 *
 * Task #27 / Phase E introduces `"annual"` — a one-time purchase of
 * 12× credits at a 20% price discount. We model this as a variant of
 * the existing monthly pack rather than a separate SKU because:
 *
 *   (a) it reuses the same checkout plumbing (router, adapters,
 *       webhooks, ledger) — only the `amountMinor` + credits-granted
 *       numbers change,
 *   (b) it matches the /pricing FAQ line "Annual plans save 20%" that
 *       has been public since v1,
 *   (c) monthly and annual share the same underlying margin model:
 *       the AI cost per credit is invariant, so a 20% price discount
 *       on 12× credits lands us at Starter 86.5% / Creator 89.0% /
 *       Pro 87.8% / Studio 87.1% net margin (vs the monthly claims
 *       of 88% / 83% / 78% / 73%), verified in
 *       docs/ai/MARGIN_VERIFICATION.md §12.3 S1 margin table.
 *
 * Keeping this an explicit union (not a boolean flag) lets the UI,
 * checkout action, admin rollup, and DB row all speak the same
 * word — "annual" vs "monthly" — instead of inferring meaning from
 * a 0/1 that lands weird in logs.

/**
 * Annual-prepay price discount, in basis points (10_000 = 100%).
 *
 *   ANNUAL_DISCOUNT_BPS = 2000 → 20% off the 12× monthly equivalent.
 *
 * Rationale for 20% specifically:
 *   - Matches the longstanding /pricing FAQ claim (changing the number
 *     retroactively would be a copy-change + growth-post-mortem).
 *   - Anchored on the "annual discount" norm in SaaS pricing — 16–20%
 *     is the typical band (Basecamp 16%, Notion 20%, Linear 25%).
 *     Landing in the middle of that band keeps us competitive without
 *     pricing ourselves into a margin hole.
 *   - Our margin headroom under cheap routing can absorb
 *     a 20% discount across all four packs and still clear the 85%
 *     floor on Creator/Pro/Studio (see §12.3 S1). Starter dips to
 *     ~86.5% — still the healthiest credit pack in SaaS we know of.
 *
 * Multiplier for annual credits: 12 (12 months). We do NOT multiply
 * the `bonus` field because the bonus is positioned in UI as a
 * "buy this month, get X more" offer — layering it 12× on an annual
 * purchase would break the cost ratio sketched in MARGIN_VERIFICATION.

// pageCount for redact + sign). The actual route refactor (move text
// extraction + chunking BEFORE spendCredits so we can compute the

// it's a 3-route refactor that touches text extraction order and
// spend/refund correctness; landing it under the same commit as the
// supply-chain scrub + badge removal would mix risk profiles.
//
// What ships TODAY:
//   - This env-var helper, exported and ready to consume.
//   - Default value `true` so the flag is on the moment Day 1.7 wires
//     the multiplier-aware spend calls (no second deploy needed to
//     activate once the route work lands).
//   - Day 1.7 callers will gate the multiplier with this helper:
//
//       const mult = isMultiplierPricingEnabled() ? pageCount : 1;
//       await spendCredits({ ..., multiplier: mult });
//
//     If complaints spike post-deploy, flip MULTIPLIER_PRICING_ENABLED

//     evaluation; older worker pools may need a restart but the panel
//     toggle handles that automatically).
//   - Removing the helper after 14 days of clean margin data is the
//     completion criterion for this part of the plan.

// Per-tool descriptive intros rendered between the dropzone and the
// reassurance cards on /tool/[id] pages.
//
// Why this file exists:
// AI tools (built on SummarizeVariantTool) had a `pricingBlurb` field
// rendering a "What you'll get + related tool link" panel. Free tools
// never got an equivalent — each tool had its own custom runner with
// no shared blurb slot. Result: AI tool pages had a rich inline panel
// while free tool pages went straight from "Drop your PDF" to feature
// cards, missing on-page context, missing related-tool cross-links,
// and (a real cost) reading as "thin content" to Google's quality
// raters.
//
// This file fixes that with a single source of truth. The renderer in
// app/tool/[id]/page.tsx reads from here for any free tool that has
// an entry, and gracefully shows nothing for tools that don't yet
// have one. New tool introductions can be added without code changes.
//
// Format guidelines (be tight):
//   - text: 1–2 sentences. What does the user get? Concrete output.
//   - related: optional ID + label of a related tool that the user
//     might want next, OR a richer alternative (e.g. AI version).
//   - The related tool ID MUST exist in lib/tools.ts. Type-check this
//     by running `node scripts/verify-tool-intros.mjs` (added below).

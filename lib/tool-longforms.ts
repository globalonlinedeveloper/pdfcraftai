// Build 2 Wave 5 (2026-04-27): per-tool editorial data consumed by
// the shared <ToolRunnerLongform /> component. Closes the
// structural-parity gap — every PDFium-backed tool now has the
// same editorial depth as PDF Inspector and Page Count.
//
// Page Count and PDF Inspector keep their custom longform
// components (PageCountLongform, PdfInspectorLongform) because
// they have unique sections (PDF health checklist, etc.) that
// don't fit the shared shape. Everything else lives here.
//
// Adding a tool: add a new entry keyed by the tool id matching
// lib/tools.ts. The runner page in app/tool/[id]/page.tsx
// auto-renders the longform when an entry exists.

      "PDFs come with two distinct flavors of restriction. Owner-only PDFs let you read freely but block printing, copying, or editing. User-password PDFs require a password just to open. We unlock the first cleanly; the second needs the password (we&rsquo;re honest about that).",

        q: "What&rsquo;s the difference between owner-restriction and user-password PDFs?",
        a: "Owner-restriction = the PDF opens without a password but blocks specific actions (print, copy, edit). The content streams aren&rsquo;t actually encrypted with a strong key — the lock is essentially advisory. We can strip these. User-password = the PDF won&rsquo;t open without a password, and the content streams ARE encrypted with a key derived from that password. We can&rsquo;t crack those, and we&rsquo;re honest about it.",

      {
        q: "Is this legal?",
        a: "Removing owner restrictions on a document YOU own (statements, your-own-work proposals, files you legitimately have rights to) is generally fine in most jurisdictions. Removing restrictions to circumvent copyright on commercial e-books or distribute restricted content is NOT — and we won&rsquo;t help with that. Use this responsibly on your own materials.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why do you reject password-protected PDFs?",
        a: "Two reasons. (1) Cracking passwords is computationally hard and we&rsquo;d be misleading you to suggest a free in-browser tool can do it reliably. (2) The strongest PDF encryption (AES-256, common since Acrobat 9) is genuinely secure with a strong password. If you forgot the password, our pdf-lib pipeline can&rsquo;t help — Adobe Acrobat with their commercial cracking tools, or asking the original sender, are your real options.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will the output preserve forms, signatures, annotations?",
        a: "Page content yes. Form data carries through if the form fields&rsquo; values aren&rsquo;t themselves encrypted (most aren&rsquo;t). Signatures invalidate — that&rsquo;s the cryptographic guarantee, signatures bind to a specific document state, and removing the encryption changes that state. If you need a signed-AND-unlocked PDF, ask the original signer to produce one.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is anything uploaded?",
        a: "No. pdf-lib runs locally. Especially important for unlock — the file might be a sensitive statement or contract, and we&rsquo;d never upload it to a server. Verifiable in DevTools → Network.",
      },
      {
        q: "Output file size — bigger or smaller than input?",
        a: "Roughly the same, often slightly smaller. We re-save with object streams (modern compact format), so depending on the input&rsquo;s era and the source app, output can be 5-15% smaller. Content is identical.",

// Build 2 Wave 5 (2026-04-27): per-tool editorial data consumed by
// the shared <ToolRunnerLongform /> component. Closes the
// structural-parity gap — every PDFium-backed tool now has the
// same editorial depth as PDF Inspector and Page Count.
//
// Page Count and PDF Inspector keep their custom longform
// components (PageCountLongform, PdfInspectorLongform) because
// they have unique sections (PDF health checklist, etc.) that
// don't fit the shared shape. Everything else lives here.
//
// Adding a tool: add a new entry keyed by the tool id matching
// lib/tools.ts. The runner page in app/tool/[id]/page.tsx
// auto-renders the longform when an entry exists.

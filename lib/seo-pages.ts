      { q: "What's 'room-rent capping' and why does it matter?", a: "Many Indian health policies cap the room-rent eligible for reimbursement (e.g., 1% of sum insured per day). If you take a higher-category room, the proportionate-deduction clause kicks in — every other charge (doctor's fees, investigations, OT charges) is reduced in proportion. Worst-case you can lose 30-50% of your claim. We flag low room-rent capping as high-severity." },

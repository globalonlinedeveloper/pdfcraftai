To strip the styling too, run Edit PDF after this." },

      { q: "What's the difference between this and N-up?", a: "N-up tiles pages in reading order — page 1 in slot 1, page 2 in slot 2, etc. Booklet imposition shuffles pages so that AFTER folding the printed sheets, they read in correct order. The math is different and they solve different problems. N-up is for compact reading; booklet is for fold-and-staple printing." },
      { q: "Why does my PDF need a multiple of 4 pages?", a: "A folded sheet has 4 pages (two faces × two halves). Source PDFs that aren't a multiple of 4 get padded with blanks at the end. A 5-page source becomes 8 pages — the last 3 are blank but the page-order math still works." },
      { q: "What if I want to print single-sided?", a: "Print 'odd pages only' first, re-feed the stack, then print 'even pages only'. Most modern printers handle this in their print dialog. Output PDF order is already correct for both sides." },

For that workflow, paid Annotate ships /Ink annotations proper." },

For finer-grain editing, a stroke list is shown so you can remove any specific stroke before applying. After Apply, strokes become part of the page content and need Edit PDF or another redaction step to remove." },
      { q: "Will my drawing line up exactly with what I see on screen?", a: "Yes. We track every pointer point in CSS pixels, convert to PDF points using the canvas's actual rendered size, and apply via pdf-lib's drawSvgPath at the same coordinates. Resize the window mid-drawing — committed strokes still align because they're stored in PDF space, not in CSS pixels." },

The link area is clickable but invisible — exactly like the hyperlinks already in your PDF. If you want to make the clickable area visually obvious, run Highlight PDF over the same region first." },
      { q: "What URL formats work?", a: "https:// and http:// for web links; mailto:you@example.com for email; tel:+15551234567 for phone numbers (mobile viewers can tap to dial). Internal goto-page links aren't supported in this tool — that's a different annotation kind. Use Bookmarks Editor (paid roadmap) for internal navigation." },
      { q: "Why does this need low-level pdf-lib code?", a: "pdf-lib has high-level helpers for drawing rectangles, text, images, SVG paths — anything that goes into a page's content stream. Annotations are different: they're sibling objects that the viewer overlays for interactivity. pdf-lib doesn't expose a high-level addLink(); we construct the /Annot dict manually with the right /Subtype, /Rect, /Border, and /A action subtree, then register it and append the indirect ref to the page's /Annots array. Doable, just not one-liner doable." },

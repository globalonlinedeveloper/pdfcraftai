// Legal pages. Ported from prototype content.jsx LEGAL_DOCS with compliance claims
// softened per Phase 1 decision:
//   - "SOC 2 Type II certified (2025 audit by Prescient Assurance)"
//     -> "SOC 2 Type II readiness in progress"
//   - specific physical address removed from top-of-page disclaimers (still on /contact)
//   - dpo@, privacy@, security@ collapsed to support@pdfcraftai.com
//   - subprocessor list kept but marked as "current working draft"
//
// 2026-04-20 — refund-policy, cancellation-policy, shipping-policy added and
// "Working draft" disclaimer banners removed from privacy + terms ahead of the
// Razorpay payment-gateway application. Stripe reference swapped to a
// vendor-agnostic phrasing until the gateway is live.
//
// 2026-04-21 → 2026-05-01 — Privacy + Terms + DPA evolution:
//   * Sub-processors named explicitly (Hostinger, Cloudflare, Google GA4,
//     Microsoft Clarity, Razorpay) on /privacy and /dpa.
//   * Cookies & analytics line corrected — "No third-party trackers" was
//     out-of-date the moment GA4 + Clarity landed on 2026-04-20.
//   * 2026-05-01: international MoR rail (previously Paddle, retired)
//     replaced with a forward-looking "international support is rolling
//     out" disclosure. Razorpay is the sole payment processor today.
//
// 2026-04-22 — Task #24: DPDP Act 2023 (India) + ePrivacy compliance.
//   * Privacy expanded with a dedicated "Your rights under the DPDP
//     Act (India)" section covering the six rights granted by s. 11–14
//     (access, correction, erasure, grievance redressal, nomination,
//     withdrawal). s. 8(10) mandates a Grievance Officer with a 15-day
//     response SLA — we name the role + contact.
//   * Privacy's "Cookies & analytics" section rewritten to disclose
//     consent-gating — GA4 + Clarity only load on "Accept all". Links
//     out to /cookies for the per-cookie inventory.
//   * Privacy adds "Children" section: s. 9 requires verifiable
//     parental consent for under-18s; we address it directly.
//   * Privacy adds "Cross-border transfers" specific to DPDP s. 16.
//   * DPA adds a "DPDP Consent Manager" forward-looking note — MeitY
//     is expected to notify the Consent Manager framework in
//     2026/2027; we commit to integrating once the CM framework is
//     live.

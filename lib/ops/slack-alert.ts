// Operational Slack alert helper (PENDING §2a / §2b foundation, 2026-05-04).
//
// One-paragraph summary
// ---------------------
// Several modules across the codebase have TODO markers that
// reference "post a Slack alert when X" — `lib/ai/margin-rollup.ts`
// emits `eval.floor.alarm` events on margin floor breaches,
// `lib/payments/dunning.ts` flags subscriptions transitioning to
// past_due / suspended, `lib/ai/quality-signal.ts` (commit
// `81087df`) wants to ping the operator when a user crosses the
// flagged threshold, and the cron-failure-escalation gap (PENDING
// §2b) needs a way to surface a missed nightly rollup. They were
// all writing to the same TODO without a shared helper to call.
// This module is that helper.
//
// What this module does
// ---------------------
// `sendSlackAlert({ severity, title, body, context? })` POSTs a
// Slack-formatted payload to a webhook URL read from the
// `SLACK_OPS_WEBHOOK_URL` env var. Three severities (`info`,
// `warn`, `alarm`) drive Slack attachment colors. Optional
// `context` is a key→value record rendered as a Slack "fields"
// block. Returns a result envelope so callers can react to a
// failed delivery without a try/catch — but never THROWS, because
// an alerter that crashes the alerting target is a fire that just
// got worse.
//
// Why not call hooks.slack.com directly from each consumer
// --------------------------------------------------------
// Three reasons:
//   1. Env-var read in one place. Today the var is unset on the
//      Hostinger panel (PENDING §2a — founder action). When it
//      lands, every consumer of this helper goes from "no-op"
//      to "live" simultaneously without per-call-site wiring.
//   2. Payload shape consistency. /admin operators reading the
//      Slack channel expect every alert to look the same — same
//      title placement, same severity color coding, same context
//      field layout. A shared formatter prevents drift.
//   3. Failure handling consistency. Every alerter must swallow
//      network/4xx errors silently — a Slack outage shouldn't
//      take down the cron job that was trying to alert ABOUT a
//      different outage. Centralizing the catch logic ensures
//      no consumer accidentally re-throws.
//
// What this module does NOT do
// ----------------------------
// - Email fallback when Slack is unreachable. Possible follow-up
//   once a transactional email provider is wired.
// - Rate-limiting / dedup. If the same alarm fires 100 times in
//   30 seconds, this module sends 100 messages. Future improvement:
//   in-memory LRU keyed on `${severity}:${title}` with a 5-minute
//   suppression window. Not worth shipping until we have evidence
//   of actual alert spam.
// - Persistence. Alerts go to Slack and stdout (for the deploy
//   log) but not to a database. Adding `ops_alerts` table would
//   let `/admin/alerts` page show history; pushing to the next
//   Phase since we don't yet have a clear use case for re-querying.

 *   - `alarm`: page-the-founder ("ai_daily_margin row missing

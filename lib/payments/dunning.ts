// Phase D / Task #22 — dunning scaffold.
//
// Status: SCAFFOLD ONLY. We do not currently sell subscriptions in
// production, so there is no live dunning to do. Today every SKU is a
// one-shot credit pack — a charge either succeeds (credits land) or
// fails (no credits, no retry). This module exists so that when
// recurring plans ship (Phase E — annual prepay + monthly tiers) we
// don't discover at billing-time that nobody ever thought about
// "card declined on renewal".
//
// What dunning is, in one paragraph
// ---------------------------------
// When a recurring payment attempt fails, the provider (Paddle or
// Razorpay) will usually retry on its own schedule. While those
// retries happen, our side has a choice: do we keep the subscription
// entitled (AI credits topped up, plan features on) in the hope the
// retry succeeds, or do we instantly cut the user off? The
// middle-ground path is "dunning": the user stays entitled for a
// grace window while we surface progressively louder in-app messaging
// and email reminders, and if all retries ultimately fail we downgrade
// the account rather than silently leaving it broken.
//
// Why scaffold now if we don't sell subs
// --------------------------------------
// Two reasons:
//   1. Webhook shapes for billing.subscription.payment_failed /
//      subscription.past_due already exist on both Paddle and
//      Razorpay. Our webhook handler (lib/payments/webhook-handler.ts)
//      would panic-log or silently drop those events today. Even with
//      zero live subscribers, a test event in sandbox produces noise.
//      Having a no-op `handleDunningEvent` gives the ingest a safe
//      pattern-matchable sink.
//   2. The admin-side /admin/chargebacks gap we just closed taught us
//      that "untracked lifecycle events become silent drift". Writing
//      the state machine down now — even as types + TODO — means
//      Phase E doesn't start from a blank page in a tense moment.
//
// Design notes for Phase E implementors
// -------------------------------------
// The model below is intentionally tiny — four states, one event
// type. Real dunning systems are more elaborate (per-retry policy,
// per-region grace periods, SCA challenge handling, multi-currency
// edge cases), but those belong with the feature, not in the
// scaffold. The shape here is meant to survive expansion:
//
//   - DunningState is serialised to JSON and stored on the user /
//     subscription row when we build it. Keep the enum string-stable.
//   - DunningEvent carries the raw provider event ID so the ledger
//     can cross-reference. No money moves in this file — ledger
//     entries only land via webhook-handler.ts once the retry
//     actually succeeds / finally fails.
//
// This module never writes to the DB today. It only exports the
// shapes + a pure reducer so the Phase E wiring can unit-test
// transitions without touching MySQL.

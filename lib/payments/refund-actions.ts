// Refund server actions for the /app/billing page.
//
// Policy (matches the public FAQ on /pricing):
//   Unused credits are refundable within 14 days of purchase. Consumed
//   credits are non-refundable. Eligibility is computed per *payment*,
//   not per user — the credits still sitting in the user's balance may
//   have come from multiple packs, so we can't cleanly say "refund pack
//   X" if the user has since spent half and bought another.
//
// Simplification (Phase 4 MVP): we prorate on a single payment at a
// time. The user can refund *up to* `min(pack.credits + pack.bonus,
// currentBalance)` credits worth of the original amount. Examples:
//   - User bought 100 credits for $5, hasn't spent any → refundable for
//     full $5.
//   - User bought 100 credits for $5, spent 30, balance is 70 →
//     refundable for $5 * 70/100 = $3.50 (70 credits' worth).
//   - User bought 100 credits for $5, spent all 100 → refundable for $0
//     (button is hidden in the UI).
//
// This keeps the math honest even when the user bought multiple packs:
// each pack is refunded only against the credits currently in-balance,
// and the ledger debit in handleRefund matches what we promise here.
//
// Security:
//   - Auth is enforced inside the action. The user can only refund their
//     own payments (ownership check on userId).
//   - The guard order matters: auth → ownership → status → age → balance.
//     Each failure has a distinct `error` code so the UI can render the
//     right message.
//   - We never trust the client on amount — the action recomputes the
//     refund $ from (balance, pack, original amount) server-side.
//
// The actual credit debit lands via the webhook (handleRefund in
// ledger.ts), which is idempotent on `${paymentId}:refund:${refundRef}`.
// This action only *initiates* the refund at the provider. If the user
// consumes credits between init and webhook arrival, the balance may go
// negative — that's accepted, documented in handleRefund's comment.

// Payment provider types — portable, provider-neutral.
//
// Design principles (from the portability review):
//   1. Internal IDs are primary. Provider refs are metadata.
//      Every Checkout is anchored to an `internalPaymentId` (UUID) that
//      outlives any single provider. Migration across gateways re-uses
//      the same internal ID.
//   2. `ProviderId` is an open `string`, not a literal union. Adding a
//      new adapter must not require a type change in callers.
//   3. Events are normalized at the webhook boundary. Downstream code
//      (ledger writer, credit granter) never sees provider-specific
//      shapes — only `NormalizedPaymentEvent`.
//   4. PCI: we never accept raw PAN/CVV. `CheckoutSession` returns either
//      a redirect URL or a client-side token the provider's hosted iframe
//      consumes. The card data never touches our servers.

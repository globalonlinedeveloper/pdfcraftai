// PaymentProvider — the portability contract every adapter implements.
//
// Rules of engagement for adapter authors:
//   - Do NOT leak provider-specific types out of this interface. All
//     shapes are declared in ./types.ts and normalized before return.
//   - Idempotency is the caller's responsibility via `internalPaymentId`.
//     Adapters should tolerate the same (userId, internalPaymentId) pair
//     being retried — if the provider supports idempotency keys, use
//     internalPaymentId as that key.
//   - Never store PAN/CVV. If the provider's raw webhook body contains
//     anything that looks like a card number, scrub it before returning
//     it in `providerRaw`.

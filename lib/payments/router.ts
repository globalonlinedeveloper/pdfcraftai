// Geo-aware checkout routing — pure decision function, no side effects.
//
// Responsibilities:
//   - Given an ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code (normally from Cloudflare's
//     `CF-IPCountry` request header), return a single `RouteDecision` that
//     tells the checkout UI what to do:
//       - `action: "route"`  → proceed to the named rail (razorpay only
//                              right now; international rail is empty
//                              until next gateway is approved)
//       - `action: "defer"`  → show the "we're not in your country yet +
//                              notify-me" form (Tier 2, e.g. EU)
//       - `action: "block"`  → refuse with HTTP 451 (Tier 3 sanctioned;
//                              defense-in-depth — the Cloudflare WAF rule
//                              per docs/GEO_LAUNCH_POLICY.md §3.1 catches
//                              these at the edge first, so origin rarely
//                              sees them)
//       - `action: "unknown"` → CF header missing or malformed; conservative
//                               "defer" response with a distinct reason so
//                               the UI can prompt for manual country
//
// This file is the canonical source for the Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3 country
// sets. Policy source of truth: docs/GEO_LAUNCH_POLICY.md §2 (tier tables)
// and §3.2 (routing example). If you change a country's tier, update both
// files; `scripts/test-geo-router.mjs` enforces that the codes match.
//
// Why this lives in lib/payments and not lib/geo:
//   - The only consumer today is the checkout flow.
//   - Non-checkout pages (marketing, docs) are globally accessible; only
//     the checkout-actions → adapter path is gated.
//   - If a second geo-aware surface emerges (e.g. a feature-flag gate),
//     extract the policy sets into a lib/geo/ module and have both
//     consumers import from there.
//
// NOT responsible for:
//   - Sub-country (subdivision) blocks — UA-43/40/14/09/65/23 are handled
//     by the Cloudflare WAF rule (see scripts/cloudflare/tier3-ofac-geoblock.json
//     + docs/ops/CLOUDFLARE_GEOBLOCK_SETUP.md). Origin never sees those
//     requests, so TIER_3_COUNTRIES is intentionally the 4 country-level
//     sanctioned entries only.
//   - Card-country vs IP-country mismatch — `CF-IPCountry` is IP; the
//     adapters (Razorpay / Paddle) use card BIN for currency inference.
//     Policy doc §6.2 documents this is a non-conflict.
//   - Currency selection — that's still the registry's job via
//     `selectProvider({ currency, mode })`. The router only picks a rail.

// SEO Ship #1 (2026-04-25): longform editorial bodies for the top 20
// head-term landing pages. Each body is ~1,000–1,500 words of useful,
// non-filler content covering how the tool works, when to use it,
// common mistakes, tips, and limits.
//
// Why a separate file: keeping this data out of seo-pages.ts keeps the
// canonical SEO_PAGES record readable. The component reads the merged
// shape transparently — call sites don't need to know about this file.
//
// Style notes:
//  - First-person plural ("we") only when describing what pdfcraft ai
//    does. Otherwise neutral, second-person.
//  - No marketing fluff. Each section earns its weight by either
//    teaching the reader something or warning them about a pitfall.
//  - Bullet lists prefer (b: bold lead) + (t: explanatory body) so the
//    eye can scan the page in 5 seconds.

Fonts, images, vector graphics, and form fields are copied by reference where the same resource appears in multiple inputs, which keeps the output file from ballooning. The merged document keeps every original page's exact dimensions — A4 pages stay A4, Letter pages stay Letter, and a landscape report stays landscape. You don't lose any quality because nothing is re-rasterized; the page contents are transplanted byte-for-byte.",

Form fields, annotations, and bookmarks that fall inside the chosen page range carry over; ones that pointed elsewhere are dropped (because they have nowhere to land).",

      "Resize PDF can mean three different things, and the right tool depends on which one you need. Changing the page size (e.g., A4 → Letter) is structural. Scaling content (e.g., shrink everything 90%) is rendering. Fitting content to a target size (e.g., booklet imposition) is layout. People reach for 'resize' when they actually need one of these three operations.",

      "Comparing PDFs sounds straightforward — show me what changed. The reality is messier: did a paragraph move, or did it get rewritten? Did a table get reformatted, or did its data change? Did the date update, or did the whole calendar quarter shift? Good PDF diffing distinguishes structural changes from content changes from formatting changes — and lets you act on each separately.",

The output is a redline document showing additions, deletions, and substitutions, plus a structured summary of changes by section.",

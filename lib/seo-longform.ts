// SEO Ship #1 (2026-04-25): longform editorial bodies for the top 20
// head-term landing pages. Each body is ~1,000–1,500 words of useful,
// non-filler content covering how the tool works, when to use it,
// common mistakes, tips, and limits.
//
// Why a separate file: keeping this data out of seo-pages.ts keeps the
// canonical SEO_PAGES record readable. The component reads the merged
// shape transparently — call sites don't need to know about this file.
//
// Style notes:
//  - First-person plural ("we") only when describing what pdfcraft ai
//    does. Otherwise neutral, second-person.
//  - No marketing fluff. Each section earns its weight by either
//    teaching the reader something or warning them about a pitfall.
//  - Bullet lists prefer (b: bold lead) + (t: explanatory body) so the
//    eye can scan the page in 5 seconds.

Fonts, images, vector graphics, and form fields are copied by reference where the same resource appears in multiple inputs, which keeps the output file from ballooning. The merged document keeps every original page's exact dimensions — A4 pages stay A4, Letter pages stay Letter, and a landscape report stays landscape. You don't lose any quality because nothing is re-rasterized; the page contents are transplanted byte-for-byte.",

If the PDF is a scan with no text, we run OCR to extract the text first, then proceed.",

The actual page content (text, vectors, images) stays in its original coordinate system; the viewer applies the rotation when it renders. That is why our tool can change a page's orientation by editing only that one attribute, leaving the entire page content stream untouched.",

Animations stop animating, transitions vanish, embedded videos become poster-frame thumbnails, and your speaker notes either come along (if you ask) or stay hidden (the default). Knowing exactly which elements survive what conversion saves rounds of \"why does the PDF look different from my slides?\".

The page dimensions match the slide dimensions — a 16:9 deck produces a 16:9 PDF, a 4:3 deck produces a 4:3 PDF, a custom-size deck produces a custom-size PDF. Slide masters and layouts are flattened: by the time the content reaches the PDF, there is no \"master\" layer — every visual element is on the page directly. Hidden slides are skipped by default; toggle the option in the converter if you want them included.",

      "\"Extract images\" sounds like one operation but is actually two — and picking the wrong one wastes a lot of time.

Converting a PDF to markdown is a hugely common preprocessing step, and the right tool depends almost entirely on the structure of the source. Heuristic conversion is fast, free, and produces excellent output for well-typeset documents. AI-driven conversion is slower, costs credits, and handles cases the heuristic cannot.

Sizes above that mode become headings: ≥1.25× body becomes H3 (###), ≥1.6× becomes H2 (##), and ≥2× becomes H1 (#). Bold runs are wrapped in **markdown bold**. Italic runs become _italic_. Paragraphs are separated by line breaks longer than 1.5× the typical line-height.",

      "Grayscaling a PDF sounds straightforward — make it black and white. Under the hood there are real choices that determine whether the output looks correct or wrong. Pure averaging of RGB channels (R+G+B)/3 makes red and green render at the same intensity, which looks unnatural — humans see green as brighter than red. The right math is luminance-weighted (0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B), the standard formula from the Rec. 601 color spec. Our tool uses that. Here is how the conversion works, the four quality presets and when to pick each, and the one thing you give up that surprises people.",

The weights reflect that perception: green contributes 58.7% of the resulting luminance, red 29.9%, blue 11.4%. Convert a green logo with this formula and it looks bright; a red logo of the same RGB intensity looks darker. Both feel correct because they match how those colors appeared in the original.",

A vendor sends one before the first meeting, an investor sends one before the first pitch, an employee signs one on day one — sometimes after a 30-second skim. The friction with that pattern is that NDAs frequently contain clauses that have nothing to do with non-disclosure: embedded non-competes, IP assignment, exclusive jurisdiction in distant cities, even employment-style restrictions. Here is what the NDA analyzer surfaces, the five most common hidden clauses, and the redline approach that lets a non-lawyer push back confidently.",

Plus a missing-clauses section that surfaces standard NDA carveouts (residual knowledge, publicly-known information, government-required disclosure) that should be present but aren't.",

The friction with that pattern is that Indian employment contracts often contain clauses with significant long-term impact: training bonds with steep liquidation amounts, broad non-solicits that extend well past employment, IP-assignment language that captures pre-employment work, unilateral transfer rights anywhere in India, exclusive jurisdiction in distant cities. These clauses are perfectly legal to include; they're also negotiable, and they shape years of post-employment options.

    title: "Chart to data table — extracting numeric data from visual chart images and what 'confidence' really means",
    intro:
      "Most data inside published reports lives in two places: numerical tables (which we extract via Tables-from-PDF) and visual charts (which are unstructured images). Extracting numbers from a chart is harder than extracting from a table because the chart is a picture — bars have heights, lines have y-values at each x, pie slices have angles. Reading the data back out requires visual estimation calibrated against gridlines, axis labels, and any explicit value labels. The chart-to-data-table tool does exactly this estimation. Here is what charts it handles, why the output sometimes returns ranges rather than precise numbers, and the cases where extraction is preferable to manually digitizing.",

Output is a markdown table with axis labels and units. The format matches how a human would represent the chart's data in a spreadsheet — one column per axis, one row per data point, headers explaining what each column means.",
          "For values that are precisely readable from the chart (e.g. a bar that's exactly at the 100 gridline; a value label printed next to a data point), the output is the exact number. For values that require estimation (e.g. a bar between gridlines, a line value where no label is printed), the output is a range with a confidence note. The tool deliberately doesn't invent precision that isn't in the source.",

The result is a familiar pattern: you submit your stack, the bank comes back asking for documents you didn't include, you spend a week gathering them, the sanction process restarts. The bundler audit short-circuits that loop by running your document stack against the same checklist banks use. Here is what it checks, the five eligibility-affecting flags that derail more applications than missing documents, and where the audit ends and lender-side underwriting begins.",

Print shops standardize on it because it eliminates the most common print-failure scenarios: missing fonts substitute, RGB colors land wrong on CMYK presses, transparency renders inconsistently across RIPs, trim and bleed boxes get guessed at instead of declared. Pre-validating your PDF before sending to the print shop catches these issues at your desk instead of as a phone call from the shop the morning of press time. Here is what PDF/X requires, the five failures that derail more print jobs than missing files, and which level (X-1a vs X-3 vs X-4) your specific print shop probably accepts.",

The standard achieves this by requiring everything that COULD vary across RIPs to be made explicit and deterministic: every font embedded so substitution can't happen, every color in CMYK (or with ICC profile for the rare X-3/X-4 RGB allowance) so RIP-specific color management can't shift values, trim and bleed boxes declared so the RIP doesn't have to guess what's intended to print vs what's marker.",

    intro:
      "Readability scores quantify how hard a text is to read. The Flesch-Kincaid grade level — the most-used score — maps reading difficulty to a US school-grade equivalent. A grade level of 8 means an average 8th grader (roughly 13-14 years old) can read the text fluently. A grade level of 16 means it requires college-level reading. Knowing the score is useful because most audiences read more easily than the writing aimed at them assumes. Here is how the math actually works, what reading-grade actually predicts about audience comprehension, and the three workflows where the score earns its place.",

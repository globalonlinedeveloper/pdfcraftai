// SEO Ship #1 (2026-04-25): longform editorial bodies for the top 20
// head-term landing pages. Each body is ~1,000–1,500 words of useful,
// non-filler content covering how the tool works, when to use it,
// common mistakes, tips, and limits.
//
// Why a separate file: keeping this data out of seo-pages.ts keeps the
// canonical SEO_PAGES record readable. The component reads the merged
// shape transparently — call sites don't need to know about this file.
//
// Style notes:
//  - First-person plural ("we") only when describing what pdfcraft ai
//    does. Otherwise neutral, second-person.
//  - No marketing fluff. Each section earns its weight by either
//    teaching the reader something or warning them about a pitfall.
//  - Bullet lists prefer (b: bold lead) + (t: explanatory body) so the
//    eye can scan the page in 5 seconds.

Fonts, images, vector graphics, and form fields are copied by reference where the same resource appears in multiple inputs, which keeps the output file from ballooning. The merged document keeps every original page's exact dimensions — A4 pages stay A4, Letter pages stay Letter, and a landscape report stays landscape. You don't lose any quality because nothing is re-rasterized; the page contents are transplanted byte-for-byte.",

If the PDF is a scan with no text, we run OCR to extract the text first, then proceed.",

The actual page content (text, vectors, images) stays in its original coordinate system; the viewer applies the rotation when it renders. That is why our tool can change a page's orientation by editing only that one attribute, leaving the entire page content stream untouched.",

Animations stop animating, transitions vanish, embedded videos become poster-frame thumbnails, and your speaker notes either come along (if you ask) or stay hidden (the default). Knowing exactly which elements survive what conversion saves rounds of \"why does the PDF look different from my slides?\".

The page dimensions match the slide dimensions — a 16:9 deck produces a 16:9 PDF, a 4:3 deck produces a 4:3 PDF, a custom-size deck produces a custom-size PDF. Slide masters and layouts are flattened: by the time the content reaches the PDF, there is no \"master\" layer — every visual element is on the page directly. Hidden slides are skipped by default; toggle the option in the converter if you want them included.",

      "\"Extract images\" sounds like one operation but is actually two — and picking the wrong one wastes a lot of time. Our Extract Images tool pulls the SOURCE images embedded inside the PDF at their original resolution. Our PDF-to-PNG tool, on the other hand, renders every page as a fresh image. The two produce different output for the same input.

Converting a PDF to markdown is a hugely common preprocessing step, and the right tool depends almost entirely on the structure of the source. Heuristic conversion is fast, free, and produces excellent output for well-typeset documents. AI-driven conversion is slower, costs credits, and handles cases the heuristic cannot.

Sizes above that mode become headings: ≥1.25× body becomes H3 (###), ≥1.6× becomes H2 (##), and ≥2× becomes H1 (#). Bold runs are wrapped in **markdown bold**. Italic runs become _italic_. Paragraphs are separated by line breaks longer than 1.5× the typical line-height.",

      "Grayscaling a PDF sounds straightforward — make it black and white. Under the hood there are real choices that determine whether the output looks correct or wrong. Pure averaging of RGB channels (R+G+B)/3 makes red and green render at the same intensity, which looks unnatural — humans see green as brighter than red. The right math is luminance-weighted (0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B), the standard formula from the Rec. 601 color spec. Our tool uses that. Here is how the conversion works, the four quality presets and when to pick each, and the one thing you give up that surprises people.",

The weights reflect that perception: green contributes 58.7% of the resulting luminance, red 29.9%, blue 11.4%. Convert a green logo with this formula and it looks bright; a red logo of the same RGB intensity looks darker. Both feel correct because they match how those colors appeared in the original.",

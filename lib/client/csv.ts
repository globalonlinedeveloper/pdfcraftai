/**
 * M22 (#193, 2026-04-29): Canonical CSV export helper for inspector tools.
 *
 * Before this, four inspectors (PdfAnnotations / PdfFonts / PdfForms /
 * PdfLinks) each carried their own copy of the same 18-line escape +
 * blob + revoke dance. Same RFC 4180 escape rule, same `text/csv;
 * charset=utf-8` MIME, same `${base}.${suffix}.csv` filename pattern,
 * same anchor-click-revoke sequence — but four implementations.
 *
 * Reasons to consolidate:
 *  1. **Test once.** A single `escapeCsvField` is unit-testable; four
 *     inline copies aren't.
 *  2. **Fix once.** When (not if) we discover Excel chokes on lone
 *     "\n" line endings or on UTF-8 without a BOM, the fix lands in
 *     one place. Today the inline copies all use bare "\n" — works
 *     for Google Sheets and macOS Numbers, fragile in Excel-on-Windows.
 *  3. **Pattern lock-in.** New inspectors (M22 expands to ~7 tools as
 *     more `Pdf*Tool` consumers add CSV) start canonical instead of
 *     copying whichever sibling they happened to look at.
 *
 * RFC 4180 conformance:
 *  - Fields with `,`, `"`, `\n`, or `\r` are wrapped in double quotes.
 *  - Embedded `"` is doubled.
 *  - Newline between rows is `\r\n` (Excel-safe; Sheets, Numbers, and
 *    every CSV parser written this century also accept this).
 *  - UTF-8 BOM is prepended so Excel-on-Windows reads non-ASCII
 *    correctly (e.g. an annotation author named "Søren" or a font
 *    named "Times—Bold").
 *
 * Why this isn't shared with TableExtractTool: that tool's CSV comes
 * out of the LLM/parser already-formatted (it owns its own escaping
 * and structure). Wrapping it through this helper would re-escape
 * already-escaped fields. Different concern, different file.
 */

/**
 * Escape a single CSV field per RFC 4180.
 *
 * Returns the field as-is if it contains no quote/comma/newline (which
 * is the common case — most field values are short identifiers or
 * page numbers). Wraps in `"…"` and doubles embedded quotes only
 * when needed. This keeps the output readable when opened in a text
 * editor instead of force-quoting every field.
 *
 * Numbers and booleans are coerced via `String(...)` so callers don't
 * have to remember to stringify.

 *   suffix-uniquify; callers that need that should run the value
 *   through `suffixedFilename()` from lib/client/download.ts first).

/**
 * Trigger a CSV download for an ALREADY-FORMATTED CSV body.
 *
 * Use this when the CSV comes from an upstream source that owns its
 * own escaping (e.g. TableExtractTool's LLM-generated tables). The
 * file's header comment documents why we don't re-escape such input
 * through buildCsv() — re-escaping already-quoted fields would
 * double-escape.
 *
 * Still applies the same Excel-compatibility floor that `downloadCsv`
 * does: prepends a UTF-8 BOM (so Excel-on-Windows detects encoding)
 * and uses `text/csv;charset=utf-8` MIME. Skips the BOM if the input
 * already has one (defensive — cheap to check, prevents double-BOM
 * if someone hands in a pre-BOM'd string).
 *
 * 2026-05-02: extracted as a shared helper so TableExtractTool's
 * download path consolidates with the inspector tools' download path.
 * Before this, TableExtractTool emitted CSVs without the BOM, which
 * meant non-ASCII column headers / cell values rendered as mojibake
 * in Excel-on-Windows (e.g. "â‚¹" instead of "₹" in INR amount cells).

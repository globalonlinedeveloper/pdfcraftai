  // ----- Free (PDFium-powered, post-nuke rebuild) -----
  // Build 1 (2026-04-27, commit after 33f0785):
  //   First tool restored on Google's PDFium engine via @hyzyla/pdfium.
  //   Proof-of-concept that the lib/pdf/ pipeline works end-to-end.
  //   The remaining 5 PDFium-applicable tools (pdf-to-jpg, pdf-to-text,
  //   pdf-to-html, pdf-to-markdown, extract-images) ship in Build 2
  //   using this same pattern. The other 34 nuked tools require a
  //   writable engine (pdf-lib, mupdf commercial, or server-side qpdf)
  //   and stay deleted until that engine decision lands.
  // 2026-04-27 SPLIT: Page Counter and PDF Inspector are now two
  // separate tools sharing the same `lib/pdf/ops/inspect.ts` parse:
  //   - Page Counter (this entry, /tool/page-count): just the count.
  //     Single-purpose, fast-answer surface for users who searched
  //     "page count" and want one number to copy.
  //   - PDF Inspector (next entry, /tool/pdf-inspector): the rich
  //     5-stat document inspector + warnings + longform.
  // Both run the SAME PDFium parse — the split is purely about
  // matching search intent (and fixing the URL/title mismatch where
  // /tool/page-count visibly said "PDF Inspector"). Each tool
  // cross-promos the other so users can upgrade or downgrade as needed.
  // 2026-04-27 (Inspector P3 polish): renamed "Page Counter" → "Page
  // Count" so the visible name exactly matches the URL slug
  // /tool/page-count. Matches the BreadcrumbList JSON-LD and the
  // competitor convention (iLovePDF, Smallpdf both maintain strict
  // slug↔name alignment). No URL change, zero SEO cost.

/**
 * Bundle G5 (2026-04-26) — single source of truth for cost display on
 * action buttons. Pre-G5, every AI tool component hardcoded its own
 * button label like `"Summarize — 3 credits"` as a literal string,
 * which meant the heading chip (which derives from `tool.cost` —
 * "AI · 3 credits per doc") and the button could drift independently.
 * The user-visible bug: chip said "3 CREDITS PER DOC", button said
 * "3 credits", and credit cost may actually vary for some tools
 * (per-page, per-question, per-table billing) but the hardcoded
 * button gave no honest signal of variability.
 *
 * This helper returns the canonical short cost string for a button:
 *   - free tool                 → null  (caller should render no cost)
 *   - fixed per-call AI         → "3 credits"
 *   - variable per-doc          → "~3 credits" (preserves the ~ marker
 *                                 so buttons honestly signal estimate)
 *   - per-unit billed (page/Q)  → "~2 credits / page" (preserves unit)
 *
 * Usage:
 *   <button>{busy ? "Summarizing…" : `Summarize — ${formatActionCost(tool)}`}</button>
 *
 * Why drop "per doc" for fixed-per-doc tools: the action verb
 * implies one document already (you click "Summarize" once per
 * upload). Keeping "per X" only when X varies (page, question,
 * table) is the honest middle ground — short for the common case,
 * informative when it matters.

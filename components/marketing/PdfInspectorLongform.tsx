// components/marketing/PdfInspectorLongform.tsx
//
// Longform on-page content for the PDF Inspector (route /tool/page-count).
// Inspector P1 SEO bundle (2026-04-27): adds ~800 words of crawlable
// content + visible FAQ + use-case section. Pairs with the
// FAQPage / SoftwareApplication / BreadcrumbList / HowTo JSON-LD
// emitted from app/tool/[id]/page.tsx.
//
// Why this is a separate component, not inline in [id]/page.tsx:
//   - Per-tool longform may diverge by tool (PDF Inspector wants
//     different copy than, say, ai-summarize)
//   - Keeps the runner page focused on the runtime, not marketing
//   - Component composition makes A/B testing and per-tool overrides
//     straightforward
//
// Future tools that get bespoke longform get a sibling component
// next to this one. Generic longform fallback can ride on
// lib/seo-pages.ts for tools without a custom component.

const FAQ: Array<{ q: string; a: string }> = [
  {
    q: "How accurate is the page count?",
    a: "Exact. PDFium parses the document's page tree directly, the same way Adobe Acrobat and Chrome's PDF viewer do. The number you see matches what your PDF reader shows.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my PDF uploaded anywhere?",
    a: "No. Everything happens inside your browser using Google's PDFium engine compiled to WebAssembly. The file never touches our servers — there is no upload step. You can verify this in your browser's Network tab while running the tool.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the file size limit?",
    a: "100 MB. Larger files would risk freezing the browser tab during PDFium's parse step. For documents above 100 MB, split the PDF first (coming soon) or use the desktop pdf-lib CLI.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does the word count show an asterisk for some PDFs?",
    a: "For documents over 100 pages, the word count is an estimate — we sample the first 20 and last 5 pages, average the words-per-page, and extrapolate. The asterisk and 'approx (sampled)' label flag this. For ≤100-page PDFs, every page is counted exactly.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does 'mixed page sizes' mean?",
    a: "We sample several pages and check if they share the same dimensions. If your PDF has, say, mostly Letter pages with a couple of Legal-sized inserts, we flag this — it usually trips up batch printing because most printers default to one paper size and silently scale or crop the mismatched pages.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why are the dimensions in inches?",
    a: "Most printers and document workflows in the US/UK use inches. Multiply by 25.4 for millimeters, or by 72 for PDF points (the unit PDFium uses internally). A4 portrait is 8.27 × 11.69 in / 595 × 842 pt.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I count pages across multiple PDFs at once?",
    a: "Not yet — batch mode is on the roadmap (Inspector P2). For now, drop each PDF separately. If you need to count 50+ files for an invoice or audit, contact support — we can prioritize the batch upgrade.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does this work on encrypted (password-protected) PDFs?",
    a: "We can read the page count of a PDF with permission-only encryption (no open password). If the PDF requires a password to open, you'll need to unlock it first — Unlock PDF tool returning soon.",
  },
  {
    q: "What metadata can you see?",
    a: "PDFs carry an Info dictionary with up to eight fields: Title, Author, Subject, Keywords, Creator (the app that produced the source — Word, InDesign, etc.), Producer (the PDF library that wrote the file), CreationDate, and ModDate. The inspector parses whichever of these are populated. Modern producers also embed an XMP metadata stream (RDF/XML); we don't surface that yet.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is some metadata missing for my PDF?",
    a: "Three common reasons. (1) The PDF was scrubbed — privacy-conscious workflows strip Info before sharing. (2) The PDF uses cross-reference streams (PDF 1.5+) that compress object locations in a way our byte parser can't follow. (3) The PDF is encrypted — we read the encryption flag but can't decrypt the Info dict. In all three, the inspector still shows pages, dimensions, word count, and reading time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I remove metadata before sharing a PDF?",
    a: "Often yes — Author, Creator, and dates can leak who made the file and when, which matters for redacted documents, anonymous submissions, or compliance workflows. The metadata you see in the inspector is the same metadata Acrobat or Preview would show. A dedicated remove-metadata tool is on the roadmap.",

          intent ("is my PDF correct/healthy/QC-passing?") than the

          something the Inspector actually surfaces, so it's not just
          generic advice — it's "here's what to check, here's what
          we'll tell you about it."

          Why this is here, not as a separate page: it's only ~250
          words and works best alongside the Inspector itself —
          users read it AFTER seeing their result and learn what to
          act on. Standalone, it'd be thin content. */}

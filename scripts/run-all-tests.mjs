// Unified test runner — spawns each of the repo's plain-Node test harnesses
// in sequence, streams their output as they run, parses the "X passed, Y
// failed" summary line out of each, aggregates the totals, and exits
// non-zero if any suite failed or couldn't be parsed.
//
// Why this exists:
//   The repo has three independent `test-*.mjs` harnesses (one per
//   subsystem: pdf-tools, geo-router, geo-waitlist). They share the
//   same plain `assert()` + `pass/fail` counter idiom but each stands
//   alone — there's no Jest/Vitest driver, and no `"test"` script in
//   package.json. That's fine locally, but in practice it means:
//     1. Developers have to remember the full chain
//        `node scripts/test-pdf-tools.mjs && node scripts/test-geo-router.mjs
//        && node scripts/test-geo-waitlist.mjs` — easy to forget one.
//     2. CI (when it lands) has no canonical entrypoint — any GH Action
//        authored against this repo would have to either hard-code the
//        same chain or duplicate it as three matrix jobs.
//     3. There's no single "is the repo green?" command for pre-push
//        sanity checks.
//   This runner fixes all three: `npm test` (once wired into
//   package.json) runs everything and returns a single verdict.
//
// Design choices:
//   - Sequential, not parallel. Each harness is I/O-light and CPU-light;
//     wall-clock benefit from parallelism is small, and mixing three
//     harnesses' output streams would make failures painful to read.
//   - Stream output live via child.stdout/stderr piping — preserves the
//     "you see what's happening as it happens" feel, same as running the
//     harness directly.
//   - Also buffer stdout so we can regex out the summary line once the
//     child closes. The regex matches the common tail — `(\d+) passed,
//     (\d+) failed` — which each harness prints (with slight prefix
//     variation: plain in pdf-tools, "Geo-router tests: …" / "Geo-waitlist
//     tests: …" in the geo suites). Anchoring on the common tail means
//     adding a 4th harness just needs the same summary idiom, not
//     runner edits.
//   - Exit code 1 on any suite failure OR parse miss — "couldn't tell"
//     is a failure, not a pass. This catches the case where a harness
//     crashes before emitting its summary line.
//   - Zero dependencies — stdlib only, same posture as the harnesses
//     themselves. Keeps `npm test` fast and offline-safe.

// Suites are run in the order they're declared here. Ordering note:
//   - pdf-tools first because it exercises the `pdf-lib` / `@cantoo/pdf-lib`
//     native crypto path; if a dependency upgrade breaks decryption, you
//     want to see that blow up before the pure-logic suites (which would
//     otherwise mask the noise).
//   - geo-router second — pure-logic, fastest, most likely to fail after
//     a data-table edit (TIER_1 / TIER_2 / TIER_3 changes).
//   - geo-waitlist last — it reads source files off disk and spot-checks
//     coverage, so it's the most sensitive to unrelated refactors.
//
// If you add a new harness:
//   1. Drop it in scripts/ following the `test-*.mjs` naming convention.
//   2. Make sure its final line prints `N passed, M failed` (rest of the
//      line can be anything — our regex only anchors on that tail).
//   3. Add an entry here.

  // OP_REQUIRED_CAPABILITY mapping, OP_ENV_VAR names, the Gemini adapter
  // shape + registry wiring, and the call-site refactor that moved every

  // posture with /api/payments/probe (no-store cache, no SDK imports, no

  // the lib/ai/margin-rollup.ts public surface (constants, pure math,
  // streak semantics, Slack emitter gating), and the cron route's
  // auth/backfill shape. Placed right after health-ai because it

  // column rename in ai_usage breaks both, and this harness pins the
  // aggregate-side consumer of those columns.
  { name: "ai-margin-rollup", file: "test-ai-margin-rollup.mjs" },
  // prompt-safety pins Task #26 / PLAN_GAP_ANALYSIS SEV-0 — the

  // Covers: the lib/ai/prompt-safety.ts module contract (exports,
  // PromptSafetyOp superset of AIOp, XML sentinel constants), wrap/
  // escape semantics (source-label sanitization, U+200B break-out escape
  // for tags + legacy === markers), safety-preamble coverage of every
  // op (ocr/translate/chat/summarize/compare/generate/sign/rewrite/
  // table/redact), jailbreak pattern library (13 patterns spanning
  // high/medium/low severity) with positive/negative cases, and
  // call-site integration (every lib/ai/*.ts op module + the chat
  // route imports from prompt-safety and actually wraps user input).
  // Placed after ai-margin-rollup because it pins the same lib/ai/*.ts
  // surface — a file-level rewrite (e.g. deleting summarize.ts) breaks
  // both, and this harness surfaces "prompt-safety call-site missing"
  // at the right granularity.
  { name: "prompt-safety", file: "test-prompt-safety.mjs" },

  // it's a self-consistency gate on the repo's own dev tooling. If

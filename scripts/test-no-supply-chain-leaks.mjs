/**
 * 2026-05-02 brand guard: tool-facing UI must not leak the AI supply
 * chain. Provider names (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini), model names
 * (Haiku, Sonnet, GPT-4, Flash, etc.), per-call latency, and raw
 * token counts have no business in user-visible components.
 *
 * Why: leaks tell competitors our routing logic, give users material
 * to compare against direct provider pricing, create support load
 * when models change, and contradict principle 2 of the locked plan
 * ("Hide the supply chain"). The brand is pdfcraft ai, not the
 * upstream resellers.
 *
 * What's checked:
 *   - All .tsx and .ts files under components/ + app/, EXCLUDING
 *     anything under app/admin/* or lib/ai/* (admins legitimately
 *     view this data; lib/ai/* is server-side routing infrastructure
 *     that consumes provider names).
 *   - For each in-scope file, scan for forbidden tokens. Each match
 *     is a fail.
 *
 * What's NOT checked:
 *   - Server route handlers under app/api/* — these orchestrate
 *     providers, so naming them is correct usage.
 *   - lib/* files outside lib/ai/* — pricing.ts mentions providers in
 *     comments (cost rationale), not user copy.
 *   - Test fixtures (test-* files).
 *
 * To extend: add a new banned token to `BANNED` and re-run. To allow
 * a specific in-scope file (e.g. an admin component), add it to
 * `EXEMPT_PATHS`. Don't add a banned token without a Plan §4.1 entry.
 *
 * Output line conforms to the aggregator regex
 * `${name}: ${pass} passed, ${fail} failed`.

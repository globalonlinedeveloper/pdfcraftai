/**
 * 2026-05-08 — Item #14 (screen reader announcements). AI tool
 * runners that render a result card on success need the OUTER
 * card wrapper marked as a live region so assistive tech announces
 * the arrival when the result lands.
 *
 * Pattern: `role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"` on
 * the outer ResultCard root <div>. Polite (not assertive) because
 * a successful op completion shouldn't interrupt — should queue
 * after the user's current focus/announcement. Atomic ensures the
 * whole region is read on arrival rather than just the diff.
 *
 * Sister to the aria-busy={busy} pattern asserted by
 * test-retry-status-ux.mjs which covers the in-flight state.
 * Together: aria-busy on click → screen reader announces "busy",
 * aria-live status on result → screen reader announces the result
 * when it lands.
 *
 * Tools that render results inline (no ResultCard function) are
 * tracked separately and follow in a follow-up sweep — INLINE_RESULT_TOOLS
 * is the explicit allowlist below so we know which ones are
 * intentionally not yet wired.
